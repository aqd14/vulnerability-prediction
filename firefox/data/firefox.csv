mechanism to display password data if an attacker could find a way to read the session
restoration file.

be installed from a different source than user expectations. Normally when a user enters
the URL to an add-on directly in the addressbar warning prompts are bypassed because it
is the result of direct user action. He discovered that a data: URL could be

would result in a bypassing of the install permission prompt. He also reported that in the
absence of the permission prompt it is possible to cause the actual installation prompt
to appear above another site's location by causing a page navigation immediately after
triggering add-on installation. This could manipulate a user into falsely believing a

in Network Security Services (NSS) where the client allows for a ECDHE_ECDSA
exchange where the server does not send its ServerKeyExchange
message instead of aborting the handshake. Instead the NSS client will take the
EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has
some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation the browser
thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange but has been silently downgraded to a
non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result if False

equivalent of the formatted content. When Reader mode is unable to process
content it displays the original web pages. Since it is unprivileged there are
no restrictions on pages linking to or framing Reader mode content. The reported
flaw is that privileged URLs can be passed to Reader mode and bypass the normal

violation of the same-origin policy then the resulting combination could lead
to arbitrary code execution.

spoofing of the location property. In this issue writes to
location.hash can be used in concert with scripted history
navigation to cause a specific website to be loaded into the history object. The
baseURI can then be changed to this stored site allowing an attacker to inject
a script or intercept posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.

incorrect SSL certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar
showing the SSL data for a previous site while another has been loaded. This is
caused by two onLocationChange events being fired out of the expected order
leading to the displayed certificate data to not be updated. This can be used
for phishing attacks by allowing the user to input form or other data on a
newer attacking site while the credentials of an older site appear on the
addressbar.

tool to find two issues involving Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The
first issue is a buffer overflow in Gecko's SVG filter code when the sum of two
values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit integer causing the
function to write past the end of an array. The second issue is a use-after-free

extremely large value the iteration of array elements that occurs
when its reduceRight method was subsequently called could
result in the execution of attacker controlled memory due to an
invalid index value being used to access element properties.",664009
