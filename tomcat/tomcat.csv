Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.92 (violetagg)|fix|62788|Add explicit logging configuration to write log files using UTF-8 to align with Tomcat's use of UTF-8 by default elsewhere. (markt)|"Add explicit "".encoding=UTF-8"" to FileHandler configurations in logging.properties"|"This is inspired by a StackOverflow question [1].

While most of Tomcat 8.5/9.0 uses UTF-8 by default, the default configuration of (Async)FileHandlers in logging.properties is to use the system default character set.

1. There is no configuration for the ""encoding"" property of those FileHandlers in the default 'logging.properties' file.

2. The default value for that property is to use the system default character set. As documented in javadoc [2].


I find this odd.

My proposal is to add explicit configuration for the 'encoding' property of AsyncFileHandlers in Tomcat 9.0.x onwards to be 'UTF-8':

1catalina.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler.encoding = UTF-8

etc.


I think that for a ConsoleHandler [3] it is expected to use the system encoding. It is used for monitoring at development time, and should not be used on a production system.

I think that a file written by a FileHandler is expected to preserve all information written to it, and UTF-8 suits better for this purpose.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.92 (violetagg)|fix|62797|Pass throwable to keep client aborts with status 200 rather than 500. Patch submitted by zikfat. (remm)|Client aborts are being written as 500 instead of 200|"Created attachment 36187 [details]
patch with a potential fix

After upgrading from Tomcat 8.0.36 to 9.0.10 I noticed new 500 errors showing up in my access logs without any associated exceptions in the application log. I believe these are caused by clients aborting their connection to the server, and that the upgrade in Tomcat versions caused the logged status code for these requests to change from 200 to 500.

Digging through Tomcat history, it looks like bug 60718 introduced an issue like this in 9.0.0.M18. After the discussion at https://markmail.org/message/4cxpwmxhtgnrwh7n it was decided that 200s were the ""least bad"" status for client aborts. The commit at https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/3b51ec4d35546a0244f4f7c4ec6c57ebfa5dd883 was made to fix this for 9.0.0.M22 by stopping IOExceptions from setting a 500 status code on the response.

When I trace through the code I see the fix from 9.0.0.M22 is preventing the 500 status from being set initially when the server first encounters an error trying to write to the client, but the 500 status is getting set later (but still before access log lines are written) as a side-effect of the ErrorReportValve.

The ErrorReportValve's invoke method has this line:

response.getCoyoteResponse().action(ActionCode.CLOSE_NOW, null)

Which results in the AbstractProcessor.setErrorState method getting called with a null throwable. This gets past the IOException guard added in 9.0.0.M22 and sets the 500 status on the response.

Attached is a patch which has ErrorReportValve pass through the Request's Throwable on that line. In my testing this seems to fix the issue."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62797

(isapir)|Add static methods to load native libraries by the Common ClassLoader|"By design, a native library may not be loaded by more than one ClassLoader.  From [1]:

> In the JDK, each class loader manages its own set of native libraries. 
> The same JNI native library cannot be loaded into more than one class loader. 
> Doing so causes UnsatisfiedLinkError to be thrown. For example, 
> System.loadLibrary throws an UnsatisfiedLinkError when used to load a native
> library into two class loaders.

Due to that restriction, Native Libraries that are loaded by Webapp ClassLoaders may only be loaded in one Webapp.  Subsequent Webapps that attempt to load the same native library fail with an UnsatisfiedLinkError.

A working solution [2] proposes to create a small jar with a method that will load the native libraries, and place it in ${CATALINA_BASE}/lib so that it will be loaded by the Common ClassLoader.

A simpler solution would be to add the static methods `load(filename)` and `loadLibrary(libname)` that will simply call the respective System methods.  That will eliminate the need to create custom jar files and place them in the lib directory.

Patch coming shortly.

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.92 (violetagg)|fix|62739|Do not reject requests with an empty HTTP Host header. Such requests are unusual but not invalid. Patch provided by Michael Orr. (markt)|Tomcat should allow blank Host header|"Changes to request handling in 7.0.87 mean that sending an empty string for the ""Host"" request header now results in a ""400 Bad Request"" response, even though the request is legal.

This can be demonstrated by running the following command:

    curl -XGET -v -I -H ""Host: "" ""http://localhost:8080/RELEASE-NOTES.txt""

The request that is sent is:

    GET /RELEASE-NOTES.txt HTTP/1.1
    Host:
    User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
    Accept: */*

According to RFC 7230 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4) it is legal for the Host header to have an empty field value:

    ""If the authority component is missing or undefined for the target URI, 
    then a client MUST send a Host header field with an empty field-value.""

While uncommon, I have come across such cases.  For example, an F5 load balancer wants to make an HTTP request to help determine whether or not a given HTTP server is still 'alive', so it creates a TCP connection and then sends the following text string:

    GET /alive.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:\r\n\r\n

Changing this string so that the Host header is not blank would, of course, be the easiest option, but it is not always possible to do, especially if the same string is used for many disparate server types.

We should modify the code (AbstractHttp11Processor, I'm guessing?) to allow a blank Host header value."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62739

On a frontend side, I have a pretty simple javascript, which sends its state updates via web sockets (text) to the backend service (simple spring app running in Tomcat).
After Tomcat upgrade (from 8.0.53 to 9.0.12), application started failing to establish web socket connections with ssl-enabled connector (""plain"" web sockets work fine). 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Generate certificate (I used steps from here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/running-confluence-over-ssl-or-https-161203.html#RunningConfluenceOverSSLorHTTPS-Option1:Createaself-signedcertificate)
2. Configure ""secured"" connector in server.xml:
<Connector port=""8443"" maxHttpHeaderSize=""8192""
                   maxThreads=""150"" minSpareThreads=""25""
                   protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol""
                   enableLookups=""false"" disableUploadTimeout=""true""
                   acceptCount=""100"" scheme=""https"" secure=""true""
                   clientAuth=""false"" sslProtocols=""TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2""      
                   sslEnabledProtocols=""TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2""
                   SSLEnabled=""true""
                   URIEncoding=""UTF-8"" keystorePass=""changeit""
                   keystoreFile=""/Users/user/.keystore""/>

With such connector settings, all attempts to establish web socket connections over ssl fail with exception above. At the same time:
1. Plain web sockets work
<Connector port=""8090"" connectionTimeout=""20000"" 
                   maxThreads=""48"" minSpareThreads=""10""
                   enableLookups=""false"" acceptCount=""10"" debug=""0"" URIEncoding=""UTF-8""
                   protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol""/>
2. All non-websockets requests work (both http and https)
3. Everything works when I downgrade Tomcat to version 8.0.53 (I didn't try other versions)

Looking a bit deeper into the problem, it seems that handshake succeeds, but Tomcat fails on the first attempt to read the data from a web socket.

It looks like WsFrameServer does not respect SocketBufferHandler settings from NioEndpoint$NioSocketWrapper at the time of its (WsFrameServer) instantiation in WsHttpUpgradeHandler, and always creates its own read buffer (WsFrameBase.java:93). Later, NioEndpoint$NioSocketWrapper tries its best to fill in this buffer as much as it could, and attempts to read directly to the buffer from the websocket (NioEndpoint.java:1204), which causes buffer check failure in SecureNioChannel.

There are several ways of fixing it.
1. The most obvious solution is to disable direct reads from the socket. Easy, but probably comes with performance degradation in some cases:

There is a workaround: to use Http11Nio2Protocol instead of Http11NioProtocol

Apache Tomcat/8.5.34

As said the culprit is Generator.TagHandlerInfo's tagHandlerClass, but why ? :)

I am unable to reproduce the problem with Tomcat 8.5.24, maybe related to changes done in https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62603 ?"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62757
Jasper|Tomcat 7.0.92 (violetagg)|fix|62808|Fix a regression in the TLD whitespace parsing fix that broke parsing when new lines were present in the method signature. (markt)|"""function-signature"" text containing line breaks causes JasperException"|"When a function was defined in tld file with function-signature containing line breaks causes JasperException in Tomcat v7.0.91.

For example
```
  <function>
    <name>getSomething</name>
    <function-class>com.example.Functions</function-class>
    <function-signature>
      com.example getSomething(com.example.longpackagename.Foo,
            com.example.longpackagename.Bar,
            com.example.longpackagename.Baz)
    </function-signature>
  </function>
```

This function definition works well in Tomcat v7.0.85 But not work in Tomcat v7.0.91.
In Tomcat v7.0.91, this definition causes JasperException like bellow.

```
Oct 09, 2018 11:22:04 AM org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationDispatcher invoke

	at org.apache.jasper.compiler.ELNode$Function.accept(ELNode.java:139)
...

```

However, according to the specification of JSR 245, ""function-signature"" can contain line breaks (LF or CRLF).
So I think that this behavior violates the specification.
http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/jsp-2.1-fr-spec-oth-JSpec/jsp-2_1-fr-spec.pdf


The detail of definition is below.
The spec of ""function-signature"" element was defined in p. 3-32 as follows.
```
            function-signature element is as follows: 
                FunctionSignature ::= ReturnType S MethodName S? 
                                      ’(’ S? Parameters? S? ’)’ 
                ReturnType        ::= Type 
                MethodName        ::= Identifier 
                Parameters        ::=   Parameter 
                                      | ( Parameter S? ’,’ S? Parameters ) 
                Parameter         ::= Type 
```

The ""S"" was defined as follows.
p. 1-27
```
S::= XML::
```

p. 1-16
```
The prefix XML:: is used to refer to an EBNF definition in the XML 1.0 speci-
fication. Refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml
```

https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-S
```
S (white space) consists of one or more space (#x20) characters, carriage returns, line feeds, or tabs.
```

He's saying that ""request.getRequestURI()"" should return an absolute URI in order to be able to get the schema as there is no other API for that. Please check the link for his exact words.

Allow additional HTTP methods by configuration

I am working on running Nextcloud (PHP web application) with the Tomcat webserver.
Nextcloud serves different ressources with WebDAV, and that requires additional HTTP methods.

Currently CGIServlet only handles the GET, POST, HEAD (and OPTIONS, TRACE) HTTP methods.

In addition I have had to implement the following HTTP methods: DELETE MKCALENDAR, MKCOL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, PUT, REPORT.
Because there are tons of other HTTP methods nowadays, I suggest to make the whole think configurable. See for example https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/6644
Alternatively, CGIServlet could just handle any HTTP method (that means just forward the method string to the CGI script, without limiting to a pre configured list).

HttpServlet subclass which will echo parameters for POST and for PUT before and after calling getParts()

This is about a servlet annotated with @MultipartConfig.

For POST requests, ""parts with form-data as the Content-Disposition but without a filename"" are available to getParameter*.

For PUT requests, such parts are not initially available to getParameter*.  If I call getParameter* before getParts(), they are never available to getParameter*, even after calling getParts().  If I call getParts() first, then they are available to getParameter*.

The servlet spec does not appear to require that PUT and POST should behave differently for multipart requests in servlets annotated with @MultipartConfig.  Even if it did, it seems very surprising that the call order of getParts() vs getParameter* would affect which parameters were available.

according to the documentation org.apache.catalina.ssi.ResponseIncludeWrapper.getContentType() should return NULL if the content type is not known. However a fallback to ""application/x-octet-stream"" is implemented and it actually sets the content type field of the object.

I had a quick look into the SVN repository and it seems this code was introduced in or before 2006. Because this was 12 years ago and because I could not find any report regarding this issue, I guess everyone else can work with that and only the documentation needs to be adapted.

However I actually prefer to get NULL. First of all for me it is bad practice to set a value in a getter (if it is not called ""lazy...""). But let me try to explain the real problem.

The control flow of SSIFilter is:
* ...
* Wrap the actual response with ResponseIncludeWrapper
* Continue and complete the filter chain
* Check the content type
* ...

The problem is when the filter chain is continued and completed, other filters that get the content type from the response (ResponseIncludeWrapper) actually change the content type of the response even though this is most likely NOT what the other filters want to do. It happens by accident, just by calling getContentType.

Also some filters rely on the fact that the getContentType returns NULL if it is not known, in order to check if they should set it on their own. They never set the content type because with the current implementation it always return a value other than NULL.

Sven."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62669

This can be very challenging for large projects. For example, we have 2,487 JSPs that need compiling. If some part of the Java code is changed that breaks hundreds of JSPs (which, admittedly, means a developer didn't do his job correctly, but still), the continuous integration build for our project fails (as it should), but the log only shows one of the errors.

The Ant task should have a new property, ""failAfterAllErrors,"" that makes it log all compile failures as errors but continue compiling until every JSP compilation has been attempted.

This is similar to how the javac Ant task works. It logs ALL of the compile errors, and only after having tried to compile everything, it fails the build.

From time to time, we suffer from two different kind of errors:

1- java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError because the tag file used in a jsp is ""not found"", but the jsp and also the tag file are there (TOMCA_HOME/work/Catalina/localhost/ROOT/org/apache/jsp/...)

2- changes in a tag file are never reflected in the rendered view(jsp)


I've took some time to debug the jsp reloading code, and here are my thoughts

Jsp reloading process at the end is calling JspServlet.periodicEvent method which triggers the process by calling JspRuntimeContext's checkUnload and checkCompile methods

JspRuntimeContext's jsps attribute is the one that contains jsps and tag references that are going to be checked from time to time, depending on checkInterval and development config values, to see if a JSP page (and its dependent files) need to be recompiled.

JspRuntimeContext's jsps attribute is backed by a ConcurrentHashMap, so the insertion order MAY NOT be preserved when we iterate through the list of jsps and dependant files. Check JspRuntimeContext.checkCompile() method.

The order in which we iterate through the tags and jsps is relevant because when a change in a tag file is detected the .java and also .class files are generated and its JspServletWrapper.reload attribute is set to true, afterwards in the same JspRuntimeContext.checkCompile() loop, when the process detects that a jsp needs to be recompiled because is ""dependant"" on this tag file  TagFileProcessor.loadTagFile method will invoke the JspServletWrapper.loadTagFile method that belongs to the modified tag, and because its reload attribute was set to true JSpServletWrapper's tagHandler attribute will be loaded again. After this process the .java and .class file that belong to that jsp will be generated 

But what would happen if we :
- detect a change in the jsp first and generate the .java and .class files (jsp needs to be recompiled because of a change in one dependant tag). 
- receive a request that match that jsp which will set JspServletWrapper.reload attribute(set to true in the previous step) to false while still ""pointing"" to the old tag class
- detect the change in the tag file which will recreate .java and .class files

Then, depending on the order of the incoming request and the jsp detection process :
- tag changes are not reflected in the rendered view
- or even worse java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError

Patch

We encounter weird errors with our webapp since tomcat 7.0.82

A change in org.apache.naming.resources.FileDirContext from Mark Thomas at 28.09.17 at 13:54
introduced the wrong behaviour due to difference in how constructors of java.io.File work.

e.g.:
File f = new File(""/tmp/"");

is not the same as:
File fp = new File(""/tmp"");
File f = new File(f, ""/"");


Thus, the changed check in the validate-method can result in absPath = ""/"" and canPath = """" ...and the check for equals fails, although its the same path!

I attached a patch to reverse the handling of absPath and canPath."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62498

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.89 (violetagg)|fix|62343|Make CORS filter defaults more secure. This is the fix for CVE-2018-8014. (markt)|CORS security: reflecting any origin header value when configured to * is dangerous|"What's the Problem?
When CORS policy is configured to ""Origin:*"" and ""Credentials:true""(default setting), current Tomcat CORS filter will actively convert it to reflect any Origin header value. This kind of behavior is dangerous and has caused many security problems in the past[1-5].

Why is that?
Current CORS standards(both W3C CORS and WHATWG fetch standard) have a clear definition for the wildcard '*', which means any domain is allowed. But they also have another important security requirement: ""Origin: *"" and ""Credentials: true"" cannot be used at the same time, to avoid overly loose permissions. Currently all browsers follow this requirement to disallow this configuration combination.

If a framework actively converts '*' to reflect any origin header value, it means ""Origin: *"" and ""Credentials: true"" can be used at the same time. This behavior leads to CORS protocol's security design to be bypassed, causing many misconfiguration security problems.

How to fix?
Therefore, I suggest frameworks to follow the standard definition of *. When a user configures ""Origin:*"", frameworks just directly returns ""Access-control-Allow-Access: *"". When a user configures both ""Origin:*"" and ""Credentials: true"" , frameworks should warn users that this is a misconfiguration, instead of return any origin header value.

https://github.com/apache/tomcat/pull/115

I am confirming the issue and stating it here for a more clear description.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Tomcat
2. Open a Browser and configure it to inspect network traffic (e.g. open ""Network"" tab in Developer's tools in Firefox)
3. Navigate to
http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/security/protected/index.jsp

ACTUAL BEHAVIOR, Tomcat 9:
The following response headers are sent by the server:
[[[
HTTP/1.1 200 
Cache-Control: private
Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 03:00:00 MSK
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=1D318BE83811595C4AAB11B7859D613B; Path=/examples; HttpOnly
Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Length: 650
Date: Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:04:40 GMT

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
The ""Expires"" header should be in GMT, like the ""Date"" header already is.

SPECIFICATION:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.3
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1

The chapter 7.1.1.1 defines ""IMF-fixdate"" production with literal string of ""GMT"". Obsolete date time formats there (""obs-date"") do not cover this case either: they are for rfc850 and asctime dates.

I spend lots of time trying to debug the issue I had.


If you need more info on config - I have:

Apache 2.4 -> ProxyPass ajp -> tomcat (java 10)
           -> ProxyPass websocket (http11) -> tomcat (same)

All this runs as docker containers so in Apache config I connect to tomcat using name ""default_tomcat_1"" - given by docker (compose). As a result after upgrading from tomcat 7.0.56 to 9.0.7 I have all websocket requests just failing with code 400. After debugging tomcat I understand that websocket requests go via Http11Processor and fail cause it receives this ""default_tomcat_1"" as host name from Apache. At the same time other requests routed via AJP are working fine cause they've got Apache public IP as ""host"".

    On apache config:

    ProxyPass /websocket ws://default_tomcat_1:8080/websocket retry=0
    ProxyPassReverse /websocket ws://default_tomcat_1:8080/websocket

    ProxyPass / ajp://default_tomcat_1:8009/ retry=0

* Properties:
** Translate 'Type' to French and Spanish
** Apply proper case (upper case) for titles and labels according to Chicago Manual of Style
** Add stylistically correct en dash in English, semirraya/raya menor in Spanish and tiret demi-cadratin in French
** Remove all status codes below 400 because they aren't errors and can't be used with this valve anyway due to line 149/150
   (Cross-references aren't present to that bundle)
** Remove reference to org/apache/tomcat/util/http/res/LocalStrings.properties, this bundle does not exist any more
** Update all descriptions in English by the most recent versions of today's RFCs (through IANA listings/references)
** Split status codes to reasons and descriptions based on RFCs

* Java:
** Import TomcatCSS class for better readablity of the code
** Obtain reason and description from properties
** Align HTML code to HTML5 style
** Change head/title to status code and reason. The user (of a browser) does not care about the server running this webapp.
   Rather inform the user upfront that an HTTP error has happened and what its phrase is. More details are on the page itself.
** Have statusHeader contain only general information, details are layed out in the body
** Don't show in statusHeader message if showReport is false (applies to the issues above)
** Always include the CSS style because even if showReport is false, it still remains HTML and a few elements are displayed
** Use boolean getters rather than the fields directly
** Use translated label for 'Type'
** Don't abuse div as hr
** Don't use underline and bold, it is considered as bad style
** Omit the message line if there isn't any
** Don't print server info with rootCauseInLogs as it is confusing with the version and duplicates the information with the subsequent line
** Use System.lineSeparator() instead of \n

Gzip Corruption Repro WAR

This appears to be same issue as posted by Christopher Taylor
Jun 30, 2011 at 8:05 am to Tomcat Users. The subject line has been preserved above.

As mentioned in the post, this seems to have arisen with this issue:
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48738

The change introduced this class: FlushableGZIPOutputStream. When we started using this, we noticed that certain string flush sequences would result in corrupt gzip output. 

The attached WAR provides a repro. The sequence of writes to the output stream that would’ve been done by our server is mimicked in this case using a file system. There are 40 files each representing a flush. URL:

""http://localhost:8080/TomcatBugReportWAR""

I’ve allowed the ‘start’ and ‘end’ request parameters to control to the starting and ending points. I’ve also allowed an ‘append’ request parameter dump anything to the outputstream.

The defaults are 0, 40, and “” for start end and append respectively.

The following query string appears particularly interesting as it seems to be the smallest sequence that causes the corruption and the subsequent string that is appended after the output is the only thing that appears corrupted:

""http://localhost:8080/TomcatBugReportWAR?start=19&end=30&append=something”

It’s also possible to reproduce this using only the FlushableGZIPOutputStream without using Tomcat at all. See attached JAR."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52121

http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html

2. If the <Resource> is configured in <GlobalNamingResources> element in server.xml, the following errors are visible in catalina.#date.log when Tomcat starts up:

ValueExpressionImpl#equals is likely not enough.

The current code just compares the hashCode():

Diff of AccessLogValve patch

The current AccessLogValve implementation uses a custom file writer instead of the normal log mechanism.  There are circumstances where it would be nice to have the power and flexibility of the standard logging capabilities.

This was briefly discussed in a email thread with subject 'AccessLogValve enhancement' from 2.15.2012

Attached is a proposed patch to add this capability, however I think it is still up for debate if this is a good enhancement.  This would be an option that people wouldn't have to use.

I believe it will work for me and is hopefully generally useful (otherwise it doesn't make a good enhancement and is just clutter.)   Earlier, I was trying to see how to do this by searching on the web and I found several others asking the same thing.  So, I think there are many others who at least think they want this feature.

Issues:
* (Potential performance, as mentioned previously)
* ""common"" pattern for AccessLogValve includes timestamp, which is also often included in log record headers.
* header messages (#VERSION, #FIELDS:, #SOFTWARE) won't repeat in log files, and are not
  necessarily useful in the initial one. (#FIELD is null, presumably because its attribute was later in my server.xml file.)"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52688

----

Sending the signal 0 to a given PID checks if 
- any process with the given PID is running *and*
- you have the permission to send a signal to it.

Now assume the tomcat process was running as root and the catalina.sh is executed as user tomcat. Then the file $CATALINA_PID exists (as well as the process) but kill -0 returns an error because the tomcat user has no permissions to kill the root process.
So the message is incomplete, thus misleading.

The error message should instead be like
""PID file found but either no matching process was found or no permission to stop the process. Stop aborted.""

Hello,

Documentation says:

-----------
The minimum time in seconds a session must be idle before it is eligible to be swapped to disk to keep the active session count below maxActiveSessions. Setting to -1 means sessions will not be swapped out to keep the active session count down. If specified, this value should be less than that specified by maxIdleSwap. By default, this value is set to -1.


The sentence ""Setting to -1 means sessions will not be swapped out to keep the active session count down."" is not true: sessions are swapped when maxActiveSessions is reached even if minIdleSwap is -1.

The Method
/**
 * Swap idle sessions out to Store if too many are active
*/
org.apache.catalina.session.PersistentManagerBase.processMaxActiveSwaps()

does not consider the minIdleSwap < 0 case, but simply swaps out sessions if (timeIdle >= minIdleSwap) which behaves just like setting minIdleSwap=0.

This way, the manager likely swaps sessions that are still quite active at that moment in contrast of the administrators' intention who wantet to disable this feature.

I suggest attached patch to fix this.

This is an absolute path. Consequently at least the Java NIO API resolves it to the absolute path /WEB-INF/web.xml. The same holds for the WarTracker constant.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.86 (violetagg)|fix|62175|Avoid infinite recursion, when trying to validate a session while loading it with PersistentManager. (fschumacher)|Infinite recursive session PersistentManager.swapIn loop with OOM|"Environment:
Windows 8 NTFS
Oracle JDK 1.8.0_152
Apache Tomcat 9.0.6
Apache OpenWebBeans 2.0.4 (OWB)
Session ID ABCDE in filesystem storage and containing an expired session.

TL;DR: Expired session is deserialized over and over again because OWB calls Request.getSession(false) in sessionDestroyed and ContainerBackgroundProcessor is unable to delete the session file while it is deserialized.


While Tomcat is starting up, I direct the Browser to request my application with session ABCDE which had been swapped out but is already expired.
Tomcat calls 
StandardSession.isValid() 
-> StandardSession.expire()
-> each registered HttpSessionListener.destroy()

Now OWB having a HttpSessionListener registered is calling RequestFacade.getSession(false) which expands to
-> PersistentManager.findSession()
-> PersistentManager.swapIn()
-> StandardSession.isValid()
... repeat until OutOfMemory

An important side condition is that FileStore.remove() fails for unknown reason. File.delete just returns false which is not very expressive. Maybe the session file is beeing read / locked accidentally the same time while the ContainerBackgroundProcessor tries to delete it. This could be caused by the session beeing read over and over again by that recursive loop where the most expansive operation is deserialization of the session, giving close to zero time for a successful delete.

[This is one reason why I better like Linux: deleting a file while it is read simply deletes the file.]

BTW: When the HTTP-Thread is blocked by a breakpoint, ContainerBackgroundProcessor succeeds in deleting the file and stops the recursion.


Here are the stacktraces of HTTP thread and ContainerBackgroundProcessor:

This makes subsequent calls to WebappClassLoaderBase.findResourceInternal to return cached resources:

http://markmail.org/message/rfm2qejzgcd2uwmh

I can confirm that the issue is reproducible in the current Tomcat 8.5 and 9.0.

Steps to reproduce:

[quote]
To reproduce the problem in tomcat 8.5.24 (for me):

 1)  make a user available with the role ""testrole"" (I just user
tomcat-users)

 2) startup tomcat, copy the war file into webapps

 3) go to the application homepage, index.jsp should auto load

 4) enter username and password and login; it should change to the username
you're authenticated with

 5) hit the auth test link and it should give you a success message

 6) hit the same link again and it should give you a 403

If you want to see how things are changing, I created an unprotected page
called /authinfo (no jsp) that shows the logged in user and role.  Here's
what it shows as you proceed through the test:

 * no user or role
 * user and role
 * user, but no role

If you do this same process in tomcat 8 (8.0.43, for me) it works fine,
particularly, the you can hit the link as many times as you want and the
roles never go away until you logout.  And generally, the login/test/logout
works perfectly, where in 8.5 even if you logout it doesn't always log you
back in the next time either.  Sometimes its takes several attempts.

Overview: 

    When mapping a servlet to the url pattern """", and specifying a security constraint like TransportGuarantee.CONFIDENTIAL, the constraint is not applied.

Steps to Reproduce: 

    1) Define a servlet and annotate with:
    @WebServlet (name = ""Root"", urlPatterns = { """" })
    @ServletSecurity(@HttpConstraint(transportGuarantee = ServletSecurity.TransportGuarantee.CONFIDENTIAL))

    2) Deploy as the ROOT web app on Tomcat configured with a HTTP and a HTTPS connector

    3) Access the server with, for example: wget http://localhost:8080/

Actual Results:

    The resource is retrieved over HTTP

Expected Results: 

    Tomcat initially responds with a redirect, and the resource is retrieved over HTTPS

My concern is that some of those preloaded classes are anonymous ones, e.g.

Referencing anonymous classes by their numbers is too fragile. It can be broken by any code modification that will cause their renumbering. Also, it is hard to review patches to SecurityClassLoad when they contain such references. See e.g. r721704

I suggest that all such classes were explicitly named. See classes referenced in o.a.catalina.security.SecurityClassLoad for an example (e.g.: o.a.c.core.ApplicationDispatcher with inner classes PrivilegedForward, PrivilegedInclude)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47214

We have a web application who has ~800 jar files under WEB-INF/lib. By default tomcat will close all the JarFile objects if there is no access to the jar file after 90s, which is hard-coded.

However, if at some point, we need to load a class that is not loaded before, tomcat will have to open all the jar files before trying to load the class. What makes matter worse is that, the disk is HDD, which makes Opening ~800 jar files quite time consuming, eventually cause this operation to block all other threads.


Lessons learned:

Enable parallel class loading, so that one thread trying to load a class don't block other threads. However, if multiple threads trying to load the same class, the issue might still happen.


New Proposal:

From my point of view, the reason why Tomcat close all the jars opened is to release the file descriptors to save resources. If resource is not a problem, we can keeps all the jar opened for a fairly long time, or even keeps them always opened. 

Therefore, we propose to introduce a new attribute, called 'jarOpenInterval', in WebappClassLoaderBase, to track the interval that can keep all the jars opened if they are not accessed. The default value is 90000 milliseconds, which is the same as the current implementation. The attribute can be configured in two ways:

1. static configuration in context.xml

<Loader jarOpenInterval=""90000"" />

2. dynamic configuration via JMX. This value should be changed during runtime.


Any thoughts?

p.s. About the default value for jarOpenInterval, I found that Tomcat 8+ has removed the implementation of the close jar operation, which indeed will hold all the file descriptors during start up. Does that mean that holding all the file descriptor is not a issue any more? Can we keep all jars open by default?"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61810

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.84 (violetagg)|fix|61916|Extend the AddDefaultCharsetFilter to add a character set when the content type is set via setHeader() or addHeader() as well as when it is set via setContentType(). (markt)|AddDefaultCharsetFilter wouldn't work when setting response header through response.setHeader()|"Overview:
AddDefaultCharsetFilter wouldn't work if one set response header 'content-type' through setHeader() instead of setContentType().
I tried to debug the webapp by adding a breakpoint in be beginning of method AddDefaultCharsetFilter.ResponseWrapper#setContentType(String), while the CXF framework did't invoke setContentType().
So I think that cxf may set response header Content-Type by invoking setHeader() but there is not a overridden method setHeader() in class AddDefaultCharsetFilter.ResponseWrapper

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Adding a maven dependecy in pom.xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
	<artifactId>tomcat-catalina</artifactId>
	<version>8.5.23</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
2) Adding a filter registeration in web.xml
<filter>
	<filter-name>AddDefaultCharset</filter-name>
	<filter-class>org.apache.catalina.filters.AddDefaultCharsetFilter</filter-class>
	<init-param>
		<param-name>encoding</param-name>
		<param-value>UTF-8</param-value>
	</init-param>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
	<filter-name>AddDefaultCharset</filter-name>
	<servlet-name>cxf</servlet-name>
</filter-mapping>
3) Adding a method in cxf jax-rs service bean UserResource.java
@Path(""hello"")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public Response hello(){
	return Response.ok(""hello"").build();
}
4) request the hello service

Actual Results:
Content-Type: text/plain

Expected Results:
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8

https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/config/http.html#Common_Attributes

However, we tested this and maxSavePostSize=0 won't disable saving POST data. Instead, it actually tries to save the data with limit 0, so if there is any POST data, a 403 Forbidden is sent in the response.

Also, looking at the corresponding source code, there is no special handling for ignoring POST data if maxSavePostSize is set to zero:
FormAuthenticator#saveRequest(Request request, Session session) creates a ByteChunk with limit 0. When calling ByteChunk#append(byte src[], int off, int len) we get to the flushBuffer() method which throws an IOException caught by FormAuthenticator#doAuthenticate which then sends a 403 Forbidden.

There is only special handling for the case where maxSavePostSize is negative (i.e. no limit)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61999

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.84 (violetagg)|fix|61993|Improve handling for ByteChunk and CharChunk instances that grow close to the maximum size allowed by the JRE. (markt)|org.apache.tomcat.util.ByteChunk throws NegativeArray SizeException|"Created attachment 35675 [details]
If growing the buffer would overflow int then just set to max value

We use ByteChunk to read in the request body and we noticed 2 things.

1.) The length of ByteChunk is limited to MAX_INT so for our purposes we can only process 2Gb requests before we need to alter our reading code.

2.) The way that ByteChunk grows means that in practice you can often only use up to 1Gb of space.

The followign exception stack is thrown when append is called on and ByteChunk over 1Gb in size:

java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException:java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException at org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.ByteChunk.makeSpace(ByteChunk.java:527) at org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.ByteChunk.append(ByteChunk.java:327)

Looking at issue number 1 it looks like a lot of classes would need to be changed to use long but I do have a patch for a trivial check that allowed us to process 2Gb requests.

Obviously this could silently truncate once you actually reach INT_MAX but it seems from the previous check based on the limit that this is the desired behaviour rather than to throw an exception."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61993

the tag execution ends. However, the way in which it grows this buffer is
extremely inefficient and has two undesirable effects:

- garbage collection is triggered very frequently to tidy up the waste.
- CPU load ramps up as large, unnecessary array copies take place.

All that's needed is a more intelligent buffer-management algorithm. I have
rewritten this class and can forward it if that would be useful (can't see a way

An Http Client which is able to send data in controlled packet size and packet interval.

When using tomcat in NIO mode as a server to receive files, and if the files are transferred via a non-stable network (there is an obvious interval between neighbor TCP packets), then the traffic always hang for a great while with zero window reported from server. Following are the steps to reproduce the problem.

1. Configure the server tcp receive window size.
$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
1024	2048	8192

2. Put the following JSP into the ROOT project. (in the path $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/consume.jsp)
<%@ page import=""org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils"" %><%
    final ServletInputStream inputStream = request.getInputStream();
    byte[] content = IOUtils.toByteArray(inputStream);
%>ok
The IOUtils is a class from commons-io

3. Start tomcat in NIO mode with the following settings
Server version:        Apache Tomcat/8.0.46
Server built:          Aug 10 2017 10:10:31 UTC
Server number:         8.0.46.0
OS Name:               Linux
OS Version:            3.10.0-229.el7.x86_64
Architecture:          amd64
Java Home:             /usr/jdk1.8.0_121/jre
JVM Version:           1.8.0_121-b13
JVM Vendor:            Oracle Corporation
Command line argument: -Xms256m
Command line argument: -Xmx256m
Command line argument: -Xmn128m
Command line argument: -Xss1m

4. Capture the TCP traffics.
tcpdump -i any -w tcp.cap port 8080

5. Start a client. sending data with http in chunks with the following settings:
chunk size                   1024 byte
time to rest between chunks  50 ms
chunk count per request      100
parallel requests            100
total requests               10000

6. Then we will got a lot of zero window packets, which lasts several seconds.

After a lot of study, I found this is because of a BUG in the BlockPoller, which will slow down the speed of polling cycle a lot.

The BlockPoller will always try to poll the Runnable event and run it until the events queue is empty. But the RunnableAdd event may wake the Worker thread, and the worker thread may add another more event to the queue. Thus the queue will be hard to shrink, and the events method will be hard to return and will affect the latency the next selection to be performed.

// events() method of the BlockPoller thread
public boolean events() {
    boolean result = false;
    Runnable r = null;
    result = (events.size() > 0);
    while ( (r = events.poll()) != null ) {
        // running the ""r"" event may cause more events to 
        // be added to the queue. then the queue will be hard 
        // to shrink, and the loop may be hard to finish
        r.run();
        result = true;
    }
    return result;
}

// the following e1 and e2 line in the RunnableAdd will wake the worker thread
public void run() {
    SelectionKey sk = ch.keyFor(selector);
    try {
        if (sk == null) {
            sk = ch.register(selector, ops, key);
            ref.key = sk;
        } else if (!sk.isValid()) {
            cancel(sk, key, ops); // <-- e1
        } else {
            sk.interestOps(sk.interestOps() | ops);
        }
    } catch (CancelledKeyException cx) {
        cancel(sk, key, ops); // <-- e2
    } catch (ClosedChannelException cx) {
        cancel(null, key, ops);
    }
}

// when the worker is waken at line L3, it will start the next loop
// and may add another event at line L2

        }
        reference.key = null;
        keyReferenceStack.push(reference);
    }
    return read;
}

In fact there is such an occasion where the previous case will happen:

 1. [Worker]: added an event, and wait on the readLatch
 2. [BlockPoller]: registered operation interest on corresponding SelectionKey
 3. [BlockPoller]: perform selection
 4. [BlockPoller]: wake the Worker on the selection result
 5. [Worker]: wake up, read data success
 6. [Worker]: add remove event (e1) to the queue, and return from the read method
 7. [Worker]: Outside call the read method again
 8. [Worker]: read data and got nothing
 9. [Worker]: add an event (e2) via the poller.add(att, ops, ref) method
10. [Worker]: wait on the readLatch
11. [BlockPoller]: enter next loop, and execute the events() method, polling events from the events queue and run them.
12. [BlockPoller]: got e1 and run it, the SelectionKey turn invalid (before next selection, the SelectionKey is always invalid)
13. [BlockPoller]: got e2 and run it, since the SelectionKey is invalid, it will wake the worker thread, and discard the event.
14. [BlockPoller]: poll other events from the queue, and run them
15. [Worker]: (before queue empty) waken up, and read again, but got nothing
16. [Worker]: add another event (e3) via the poller.add(att, ops, ref) method
17. [Worker]: wait on the readLatch again
18. [BlockPoller]: got e3 and run it, found it invalid again, wake the worker thread, and discard the event.
19. [Worker]: being waken up again and add event again...


steps between 11 to 17 will repeat again and again (step 18 and later is a replay of the steps), if each time the event add in step 16 add the event to the queue before the queue is consumed to empty, because the BlockPoller will always try to empty the queue. 

Then the BlockPoller and the worker will enter a strange loop, where the BlockPoller will try to empty the queue, while the worker will always add some more events to the queue.

My solution to prevent this problem, is to prevent the BlockPoller from trying to empty the queue before move to the selection step, instead, make it only handle events in the queue when it starts to handle them, further events added later will not be handled during this BlockPoller loop, but instead delay to the next loop. The selection operation will remove all invalid SelectionKeys, so in the time of the next loop, the problem will not happen again, since the SelectionKeys are all fresh and valid."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61736

Patch to correctly detect JDK 9

When trying to install Tomcat 9.0.1 on Windows (x64) where the JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the JDK 9, service.bat fails to recognize the Java binaries:

> C:\apache-tomcat-9.0.1\bin>service install
> The JAVA_HOME environment variable is not defined correctly

This is because service.bat checks for ""java.exe"", ""javaw.exe"" and ""server\jvm.dll"" within a ""jre\bin"" directory, but the ""jre"" directory doesn't exist on JDK 9.

Instead, the necessary binaries can be found directly within the JDK's ""bin"" folder.


Note: Running the Tomcat Service using the SYSTEM user (root) works, but if you want to run the Tomcat Service as a different user with Java 9, it seems that additionally to having access to the Tomcat directory (e.g. ""D:\Tomcat""), the user also must have read access access to its parent directory (e.g. ""D:\"") (or even the drive root) for some reason.
Otherwise (if the user only has access to the Tomcat directory), starting the service will fail and the following error will be printed to stderr.log:

To the app it appears the client certificate was not sent.

Example code (JSP fragment, can be the only content of a JSP file):

User client cert data:
<%= ((java.security.cert.X509Certificate[])
request.getAttribute(""javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate""))[0].
getSubjectX500Principal().toString()%>

After a few refreshes of the page (where it will show the client certificate DN) the page will fail with a NullPointerException as request.getAttribute will return null. It usually happens in less than a minute. To be more precise: when reloading about once per second, the problem occurs almost every time after 30 seconds. After that each request will fail the same way, until I restart tomcat.

This happens with Firefox (v39 and v40) and Chrome (v44), but not with IE v11.

It also occurs with different versions of tomcat and Java (and OS bitness) - see below for a list.

A simple test case using latest versions is:

    download and extract apache-tomcat-8.0.24-windows-x64.zip
    in the webapps folder create a folder named cert, there create a file named ccertA.jsp that contains the above code snippet

    in server.xml add a line:

    start tomcat by executing startup.bat
    open the page https://localhost:8443/cert/ccertA.jsp and keep refreshing it every few seconds
    After about 30 seconds it will show a NPE exception error page.

A similar issue was discussed on the tomcat-users mailing list in 2010: ""Client certificate gone after 1 minute timeout (SSL, APR)"" [1] but with no solution. I posted there myself recently ( ""Firefox SSL with APR - losing client certificate"" [2] has a bit more details), but it is basically just my monologue.


Originally I tested with a server certificate issued by my private testing CA. Now I also tried with a ""real"" certificate issued by trusted CA. (I used my personal certificate. The browser complained about the hostname mitmatch which I clicked away).


Can upload test CA, server-cert/key and client cert/key for test if requiered.

Patch provided by WangZheng.

spring.datasource.tomcat.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.datasource.tomcat.username=admin

Then I run my application, 60 seconds later, all the database connections become into ""<IDLE> in transaction"".

Why does this happen? I look into the ""PooledConnection.java"" source code, and I get the reason.

In the above configuration, I set the ""testWhileIdle"" to ""true"", so every connection in the pool will be tested to see if it is idle, using the specified SQL ""SELECT 1"".
After executing the SQL, the connection does not call commit() or rollback(). We know that if the connection is auto committed, this is OK.
But because I set the ""defaultAutoCommit"" to ""false"", so the connection will not be committed automatically, and so the connection will always stay in the status of ""<IDLE> in transaction"", and I think this is incorrect."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61425
jdbc-pool|Tomcat 7.0.82 (violetagg)|fix|61545|Correctly handle invocations of methods defined in the PooledConnection interface when using pooled XA connections. Patch provided by Nils Winkler. (markt)|ProxyConnection.invoke() does not handle javax.sql.PooledConnection method calls|"I've found an issue with tomcat-jdbc and XA connections, where Tomcat Pool's ProxyConnection class does not handle invocations done using the javax.sql.PooledConnection interface.

I'm seeing this with Tomcat v7.0.78, but the same code is used in Tomcat's 8.5 codebase. My use case involves the following setup:

* Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle - same issue on all three of them.
* Tomcat Pool is used to define a context-specific XADataSource to be used by the web application.
* The web application uses Spring for setup, and Jencks as an XA transaction manager.
* Jencks uses tranql-connector under the hood (version 1.7 or 1.8 show the same behavior).

The issue can be seen from Tranql's code: http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.tranql/tranql-connector/1.8/org/tranql/connector/jdbc/ManagedXAConnection.java?av=f#55

Here, tranql gets an XAConnection from the pool (Tomcat Pool in this case) and tries to set a ConnectionEventListener on the connection:

       this.xaConnection = xaConnection;
         xaConnection.addConnectionEventListener(new ConnectionEventListener() {
                     public void connectionClosed(ConnectionEvent event) {
                 //we should be handling this independently
             }
 
                     public void connectionErrorOccurred(ConnectionEvent event) {
                 Exception e = event.getSQLException();
                 unfilteredConnectionError(e);
             }
         });

The xaConnection.addConnectionEventListener gets propagated through the JdbcInterceptor hierarchy in Tomcat Pool, all the way to the ProxyConnection.invoke() method: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/ProxyConnection.java?view=markup#l92

Since the addConnectionEventListener method is defined on javax.sql.PooledConnection, none of the if-clauses in the ProxyConnection.invoke() method match and the code finally ends up in line 126, where the ""addConnectionEventListener"" is invoked on the java.sql.Connection instance, which of course does not implement the javax.sql.PooledConnection interface: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/ProxyConnection.java?view=markup#l126

PooledConnection poolc = connection;
if (poolc!=null) {
    return method.invoke(poolc.getConnection(),args);
} else {
    throw new SQLException(""Connection has already been closed."");
}

The error that is shown looks like this:

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: object is not an instance of declaring class

	... 111 more

In the case of Oracle, the ""poolc.getConnection()"" call returns an instance of oracle.jdbc.driver.LogicalConnection, which does not implement javax.sql.PooledConnection.

Since javax.sql.XAConnection extends the javax.sql.PooledConnection interface, the reason for the error stems from the check in line 106 of ProxyConnection.java: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/modules/jdbc-pool/src/main/java/org/apache/tomcat/jdbc/pool/ProxyConnection.java?view=markup#l106

} else if (method.getDeclaringClass().equals(XAConnection.class)) {
    try {
        return method.invoke(connection.getXAConnection(),args);
    }catch (Throwable t) {

The code does the right thing (using the ""connection.getXAConnection()"" instance to invoke calls that are supposed to be done on an XAConnection, but it fails to account for the fact that javax.sql.XAConnection also extends the javax.sql.PooledConnection interface. Due to this incomplete check, the call to javax.sql.PooledConnection.addConnectionEventListener() is not detected here, but falls through to the call in line 126.

The code in line 106 should be changed to not only check for calls made to XAConnection, but also include methods defined in super-classes (or super-interfaces) of XAConnection:

} else if (method.getDeclaringClass().isAssignableFrom(XAConnection.class)) {


Using ""isAssignableFrom"" instead of ""equals"" accomplishes that.

(rjung)|daemon.sh's auto-detection fails on linux system's where java is installed via an RPM|"On RHEL/Centos/Fedora, when java is installed from the RPMs neither JAVA_HOME nor JRE_HOME environment variables are set. Luckily, the Tomcat startup scripts are able to auto-detect them but the daemon.sh script cannot properly do so. The failure is in the JAVA_HOME auto-detection in the script here:

daemon.sh:96:

~~~
JAVA_BIN=""`which java 2>/dev/null || type java 2>&1`""
test -x ""$JAVA_BIN"" && JAVA_HOME=""`dirname $JAVA_BIN`""
test "".$JAVA_HOME"" != . && JAVA_HOME=`cd ""$JAVA_HOME/.."" >/dev/null; pwd`
~~~

The problem is that when java is installed from the RPMs, `which java` evaluates to '/usr/bin/java', which is a symlink maintained by alternatives. The code snippet above will evaluate to JAVA_HOME and JRE_HOME being set to '/usr'. Having JRE_HOME set to '/usr' doesn't seem to cause problems for Tomcat, but the problem manifests itself when running the daemon.sh script:

~~~
# ./daemon.sh start
Cannot find any VM in Java Home /usr
~~~
 
jsvc is only used in daemon.sh, therefore this problem was not seen when starting Tomcat using startup.sh or catalina.sh.

I think a good fallback for JAVA_HOME and JRE_HOME is '/usr/lib/jvm/java' and '/usr/lib/jvm/jre' respectively.

To Reproduce:

1. Install tomcat
2. Install java from RPMs
3. cd $CATALINA_HOME

The reason was that we added -Duser.dir=<customDir> to give Tomcat a uniqe working dir. Within our <customDir> there was a directory which was not accessible for the tomcat user. It belongs to root and no one else has access. So tomcat tries to scan the user.dir and tries to list files within the restricted dir. 

Doing so ths file.listFiles() command retuns null (instead of a list of files) which is not correctly handled and causing this Nullpointer and preventing the Server from startup.

to recrate set -Duser.dir in setenv.sh to /tmp, create a folder /tmp/test, give permission 700 to /tmp/test, chwon root:root /tmp/test and start a tomcat with at least one application and a user other than root.

The fix would be to correctly handle nullpointers or to simply write a meningfull log message.

my hacky patch

I have worked with ‎csutherl‎ on #tomcat on irc.freenode.net who decided this is a bug and should be reported here rather than the ML.

JDK version tested was oracle JDK 1.8.0_66.

I have set connectionURL and alternateURL to try to get LDAP server failover to work.

If both servers are up, it ""works well"".
If only the connectionURL server is down (firewall is set to REJECT) then a newly restarted tomcat works fine, but if it goes down while tomcat is already running, the next LDAP lookup takes 15m32s.
If only the alternateURL server is down (firewall is set to REJECT) then a newly restarted tomcat works fine, but if it goes down while tomcat is already running, and the connectionURL server was down before but up again now (so the JNDIRealm's instance variable ""context"" is currently set using alternateURL) the next LDAP lookup takes 15m32s.

Setting connectionTimeout has no effect on the time. I have verified it ends up in the Hashtable returned by getDirectoryContextEnvironment().

And if I apply my hacky patch (attached, applies to tomcat85 git repo, tag TOMCAT_8_5_16) for the method ""JNDIRealm.open()"" so it works like a fresh tomcat startup, and never returns the old context (closes it and sets it to null, then lets the rest of the code run), it always ""works well"", taking 4-7s on a fresh tomcat, or less than 0.1s on a warmed up tomcat.

server.xml snippets:

    <Realm className=""org.apache.catalina.realm.MemoryRealm"" digest=""MD5"" />
    </Realm>
    
    <Realm className=""org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm""

    # run this on machines that should work
    t LOG
    # run this on machines that should fail
    t REJECT
    
the test:
    # prerequisite for the test is a server named ""auth1"" and another ""auth2"" which run on port 389. In our case it's slapd, and they have start_tls enabled but not required.
    # on both LDAP servers:
    t LOG

    # then start tomcat, then
    # on the first LDAP server:
    t REJECT

    # on a test machine (content of the user and password here shouldn't matter... we aren't testing authentication, only time taken)
    time curl --user someuser:somepassword http://exampledomain:8080/dummy-service/test/ldap

    (ignore response, but look at time taken)

result:
    Almost always takes 15m32.4s plus up to 4s or so, but usually within a few ms.
    When it ""works well"" (described in detail above), the first run takes about 4-7s, and after that it takes around 0.02s to 0.1s.
    
expected:
    It should always be quick, within some small multiple of the connection timeout, preferrably 1x. So in this case, it should take about 1s extra, or at most a few seconds, so 1.1s on a warmed up tomcat.

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.80 (violetagg)|fix|61086|Ensure to explicitly signal an empty request body for HTTP 205 responses. Additional fix to r1795278. Based on a patch provided by Alexandr Saperov. (violetagg)|Some clients hang when HTTP responses give status 205 Reset Content|"Created attachment 34992 [details]
Exemple standalone servlet to give out HTTP 205 response

When a servlet running on Tomcat sends a response over HTTP with status 205 Reset Content, some clients hang with this response and just wait for it to ""complete"" after Tomcat considers it fully done.

So far I've identified two clients:
- command line program curl, version 7.52.1,
- Jersey client, version 1.19.1.

Using Tomcat 8.5.15 (latest release), but the issue was here for as long as I went back and it seems still here in Tomcat 9.

Debugging the HTTP communication shows it has to do with the fact that the response has no body (which is correct, as mandated by RFC for status 205), and no indication of content length to explicitly say that there is no body. That last part is incorrect behavior according to RFC 7231 section 6.3.6:

   "" Since the 205 status code implies that no additional content will be provided, a server MUST NOT generate a payload in a 205 response.  In other words, a server MUST do one of the following for a 205 response: a) indicate a zero-length body for the response by including a Content-Length header field with a value of 0; b) indicate a zero-length payload for the response by including a Transfer-Encoding header field with a value of chunked and a message body consisting of a single chunk of zero-length; or, c) close the connection immediately after sending the blank line terminating the header section. ""

It seems the HTTP clients I've identified, do rely on this requirement stated by RFC. Testing with servers that do add a Content-Length: 0 header or a Transfer-encoding chunked with a zero-length chunk with a status 205, these clients behave as expected. Also note, that Tomcat will typically eventually reach its keep-alive timeout and close the connection. Which is actually a valid way to end the response, and these clients do accept it when they don't reach their own timeouts. It's just the response takes by default 20 seconds to be finished, and is done with closing a perfectly re-usable connection.

Steps to reproduce:

 (1) Have a clean Tomcat install version 8.5.15

 (2) Deploy on it a root webapp that responds to requests with
     HTTP status 205.

     You can use the standalone servlet class I put in attachment.
     As can be seen, it responds to all requests with status 205,
     and it adds a custom header just to be sure the response comes
     from this servlet.

 (3) Make an HTTP request to it with curl.

     Response looks like:

$ curl -v http://localhost:8080
* STATE: INIT => CONNECT handle 0x6000578f0; line 1413 (connection #-5000)
* Rebuilt URL to: http://localhost:8080/
* Added connection 0. The cache now contains 1 members

* STATE: WAITPERFORM => PERFORM handle 0x6000578f0; line 1817 (connection #0)
* HTTP 1.1 or later with persistent connection, pipelining supported

* multi_done
* Curl_http_done: called premature == 0
* Closing connection 0
* The cache now contains 0 members

     curl hangs for a while after ""Marked for [closure]: HTTP: No end-of-message indicator"".
     Then after 20 seconds Tomcat reaches connection
     keep-alive timeout, closes the connection and curl
     accepts it as a valid way to finish the response.

Proposed (naive) patch:

I have located the cause for this behavior, in class
org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor
in line 1144.
Status 205 is treated the same way as 204 and 304,
that is to say no body as mandated by RFC,
but also no content length information.

The naive patch attached just removes 205 from those,
which solves the issue with the problematic clients.
However it makes it possible to add a body to a
205 response, and it becomes the webapp's author's
responsibility to not do that.

Another, possibly better, approach, could be to
have a special case for 205 only, where it
would ignore any attempt to put a content,
but it would add the header Content-Length: 0."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61086

I attached a patch for the tomcat nsis installer that enables the installer to read it's default values from an ini file (config.ini) instead of using the in script defined onces. If the ini file does not exist, the script values are used. The same happens if the ini file exists, but a value is not defined. E.g. maybe you want to go with all of the script defined values but one or so. Please look at the attached diff. 

This is how a sample config.ini file would look like (filename must be config.ini and reside in $EXEDIR)

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.79 (violetagg)|fix|61101|CORS filter should set Vary header in response. Submitted by Rick Riemer. (remm)|CorsFilter should add Vary header to response|"The Tomcat CorsFilter does not add a Vary header to the response to indicate that the response can vary for different values of the Origin header in the request. This poses problems for caches, as they can yield cached Tomcat responses where they shouldn't because they don't know that a different Origin value may yield a different response.

The filter should add the Origin value to the Vary header of the response.

Per the CORS standard (https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#resource-implementation):
""Resources that wish to enable themselves to be shared with multiple Origins but do not respond uniformly with ""*"" must in practice generate the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header dynamically in response to every request they wish to allow. As a consequence, authors of such resources should send a Vary: Origin HTTP header or provide other appropriate control directives to prevent caching of such responses, which may be inaccurate if re-used across-origins.""

Found this on multiple versions of the Tomcat CorsFilter (7, 8.0 and 8.5). A quick code inspection shows that this isn't present in /trunk either.

Found with multiple Java versions, at least including Oracle JDK 8u131 64-bit on Windows 10 64-bit. Seems to be unrelated to the connectors (found on the HTTP NIO and BIO connectors)

To reproduce, enable the CorsFilter in Tomcat's web.xml, and send an HTTP request that includes both a Host and an Origin header, where the Origin should be different than the Host, and should be a value that is configured to be allowed by the CorsFilter. Inspect the response headers. A 'Vary: Origin' header should be in the response, but isn't."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61101

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.79 (violetagg)|fix|61086|Explicitly signal an empty request body for HTTP 205 responses. (markt)|Some clients hang when HTTP responses give status 205 Reset Content|"Created attachment 34992 [details]
Exemple standalone servlet to give out HTTP 205 response

When a servlet running on Tomcat sends a response over HTTP with status 205 Reset Content, some clients hang with this response and just wait for it to ""complete"" after Tomcat considers it fully done.

So far I've identified two clients:
- command line program curl, version 7.52.1,
- Jersey client, version 1.19.1.

Using Tomcat 8.5.15 (latest release), but the issue was here for as long as I went back and it seems still here in Tomcat 9.

Debugging the HTTP communication shows it has to do with the fact that the response has no body (which is correct, as mandated by RFC for status 205), and no indication of content length to explicitly say that there is no body. That last part is incorrect behavior according to RFC 7231 section 6.3.6:

   "" Since the 205 status code implies that no additional content will be provided, a server MUST NOT generate a payload in a 205 response.  In other words, a server MUST do one of the following for a 205 response: a) indicate a zero-length body for the response by including a Content-Length header field with a value of 0; b) indicate a zero-length payload for the response by including a Transfer-Encoding header field with a value of chunked and a message body consisting of a single chunk of zero-length; or, c) close the connection immediately after sending the blank line terminating the header section. ""

It seems the HTTP clients I've identified, do rely on this requirement stated by RFC. Testing with servers that do add a Content-Length: 0 header or a Transfer-encoding chunked with a zero-length chunk with a status 205, these clients behave as expected. Also note, that Tomcat will typically eventually reach its keep-alive timeout and close the connection. Which is actually a valid way to end the response, and these clients do accept it when they don't reach their own timeouts. It's just the response takes by default 20 seconds to be finished, and is done with closing a perfectly re-usable connection.

Steps to reproduce:

 (1) Have a clean Tomcat install version 8.5.15

 (2) Deploy on it a root webapp that responds to requests with
     HTTP status 205.

     You can use the standalone servlet class I put in attachment.
     As can be seen, it responds to all requests with status 205,
     and it adds a custom header just to be sure the response comes
     from this servlet.

 (3) Make an HTTP request to it with curl.

     Response looks like:

$ curl -v http://localhost:8080
* STATE: INIT => CONNECT handle 0x6000578f0; line 1413 (connection #-5000)
* Rebuilt URL to: http://localhost:8080/
* Added connection 0. The cache now contains 1 members

* multi_done
* Curl_http_done: called premature == 0
* Closing connection 0
* The cache now contains 0 members

     curl hangs for a while after ""Marked for [closure]: HTTP: No end-of-message indicator"".
     Then after 20 seconds Tomcat reaches connection
     keep-alive timeout, closes the connection and curl
     accepts it as a valid way to finish the response.

Proposed (naive) patch:

I have located the cause for this behavior, in class
org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor
in line 1144.
Status 205 is treated the same way as 204 and 304,
that is to say no body as mandated by RFC,
but also no content length information.

The naive patch attached just removes 205 from those,
which solves the issue with the problematic clients.
However it makes it possible to add a body to a
205 response, and it becomes the webapp's author's
responsibility to not do that.

Another, possibly better, approach, could be to
have a special case for 205 only, where it
would ignore any attempt to put a content,
but it would add the header Content-Length: 0."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61086

- Fail: the servlet writes the response synchronously after startAsync (described above)

We have recently ran into a deadlock situation in a customer site while using websockets.
One of the locks is in our code while the other is the Tomcat ""stateLock"" defined in ""class WsSession"".

I have marked this issue as a regression because one of the 2 locations that Tomcat takes the stateLock in 8.0.33 did not exist in 8.0.29. Here's a quick look at the differences before examining the deadlocked call stacks:

In 8.0.33 there's an expansion of the stateLock usage:
    protected void registerFuture(FutureToSendHandler f2sh) {
        boolean fail = false;
        synchronized (stateLock) {
			// leaving out the details...
		}
	}
		
While in 8.0.29 the entire method looks like:
    protected void registerFuture(FutureToSendHandler f2sh) {
        futures.put(f2sh, f2sh);
    }

I can understand why the stateLock usage has been expanded. But I think there is a problem with this. Previously we'd only enter stateLock in Tomcat -> Application calls. Now with the new registerFuture we also can enter stateLock in Application -> Tomcat calls.
So a recent change seems to have introduced a key ingredient for deadlocks. If my application has its own lock there is the potential for 2 locks to be acquired in reverse order by 2 simultaneous threads. 

We have experienced a real-world example of this:

In the 1st thread Tomcat is closing the session after an abrupt disconnect from the client. The close action bubbles up to the Application onClose handler:

In the 2nd thread the Application is simply sending a normal message to Tomcat (unaware the session is closing simultaneously):

                   Local Variable: com.myc.customer.model.json.notification.NewMessageNotification#3

Our interface to Tomcat (wsOutbound.java) takes the Application lock using class ""synchronized"" as follows:

    public synchronized void setSocketStatus(SocketStatus status) {
		// Does some state change stuff. Can be invoked from onClose()
	}
	
	public synchronized boolean send(Object obj) {
		// Sends one or more messages to Tomcat
	}
	
So we had a simple locking strategy. Now I have to come up with a message queuing strategy so that I can send multiple messages, in order, without holding an Application lock.

To my mind the root problem is in the existing Tomcat code for doClose(). In other deadlock situations I've been involved with the onus has been on the thread that invokes a callback/listener to exit any locks it holds first:

    private void doClose(CloseReason closeReasonMessage,
            CloseReason closeReasonLocal) {
        // Double-checked locking. OK because state is volatile
        if (state != State.OPEN) {
            return;
        }

        synchronized (stateLock) {
            if (state != State.OPEN) {
                return;
            }

            if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
                log.debug(sm.getString(""wsSession.doClose"", id));
            }
            try {
                wsRemoteEndpoint.setBatchingAllowed(false);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                log.warn(sm.getString(""wsSession.flushFailOnClose""), e);
											<-- Exit stateLock first?
                fireEndpointOnError(e);
            }

            state = State.CLOSING;

            sendCloseMessage(closeReasonMessage);
											<-- Exit stateLock first?
            fireEndpointOnClose(closeReasonLocal);
											<-- Reenter stateLock?
            state = State.CLOSED;
        }

See the implementation of SessionIdGeneratorBase.createSecureRandom(), where the ""result = new SecureRandom()"" line doesn't seem to be triggered for this case (secureRandomProvider=null, secureRandomAlgorithm="""").

Getting the platform default SecureRandom algorithm is wanted on Linux systems where /dev/random blocks or is slow, either due to misconfiguration or exhaustion. See the latest comment on http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4705093 for a description of the current SecureRandom behavior. Regardless of that problem, and the motivation it provides for being able to easily get a default algorithm SecureRandom, I believe the former paragraph describes either a documentation or implementation bug in itself, so unless requested I don't think it's necessary to prove in this bug entry that Tomcat hangs on such a system.

WebSocket|Tomcat 7.0.78 (violetagg)|fix|61003|Ensure the flags for reading/writing in o.a.t.websocket.AsyncChannelWrapperSecure are correctly reset even if some exceptions occurred during processing. (markt/violetagg)|Secure Websocket client hides Exception on error, and throws an IllegalStateException instead|"Created attachment 34924 [details]
The stack trace

We encounter the following exception (full stack attached) instead of a proper exception, such as a time out:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: Concurrent write operations are not permitted
	at org.apache.tomcat.websocket.AsyncChannelWrapperSecure.write(AsyncChannelWrapperSecure.java:116)

AsyncChannelWrapperSecure javadoc interestingly states ""This needs a lot more testing before it can be considered robust."", and indeed this class seems to be the cause of the issue. More details about what I suspect is going on:


If you take a closer look at WsRemoteEndpointImplBase.sendMessageBlock line 313, you will find this section:

         for (MessagePart mp : messageParts) {
            writeMessagePart(mp);
            if (!bsh.getSendResult().isOK()) {
                messagePartInProgress.release();
                Throwable t = bsh.getSendResult().getException();
 // Bug alert!! Here we will write again, but may not have reset the writing flag of AsyncChannelWrapperSecure to false 
                wsSession.doClose(new CloseReason(CloseCodes.GOING_AWAY, t.getMessage()),
                        new CloseReason(CloseCodes.CLOSED_ABNORMALLY, t.getMessage()));
                throw new IOException (t);
            }

which is problematic: The writeMessagePart method will eventually call doWrite of WsRemoteEndpointImplClient, which will simply return in case of exceptions:

  try {
                channel.write(byteBuffer).get(timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
            } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | TimeoutException e) {
                handler.onResult(new SendResult(e));
                return;
            }

So here, when the get fails, the  WriteTask of AsyncChannelWrapperSecure, will not have finished, and so will not have unset its write flag, meaning that the wsSession.doClose call done in WsRemoteEndpointImplBase.sendMessageBlock will fail to write. 
Moreover, the write flag of the WriteTask is not reset in the finally block, meaning that any other exception thrown by the write task will cause the completion of the future, but will not allow to write in the ws either, causing another failure.

This will mean that it will fail to throw the actual cause of the exception stored in the SendResult.

This is caused by a missing sslsessionId in this code:
request.setRequestedSessionId(request.getAttribute(SSLSupport.SESSION_ID_KEY).toString());

A close look with a debugger shows that the request attribute is not present and this leads to a NullpointerException because of the toString() method call on a null value.

Further reading in RFC 5077 section 3.4 (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077#section-3.4) leads us to the conclusion that the client decides if it wants to include the session id in the request or not.
Thus the parseSessionSslId method should be aware of the possibility that the session id might be missing.

I think the Code in the parseSessionSslId method should look like this:
String sessionId = request.getAttribute(SSLSupport.SESSION_ID_KEY);
request.setRequestedSessionId(sessionId == null ?  sessionId : sessionId.toString());

SVN diff of fix on Apache Tomcat 8.5.x-trunk repo

The bug manifested itself when I:
1. Created a custom composite control in JSF.
2. *ERRONEOUSLY* Defined an attribute with a method signature of ""void actionListener(object)"" -- it should have been ""void actionListener(javax.faces.event.AjaxBehaviorEvent)"".
3. Trigger a call on the method through JSF.

When matching the method signature, org.apache.el.util.ReflectionUtil throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at line 210.

The bug is due to is missing check that paramValues is empty (it only checks if it is not null, and then proceeds to evaluate paramValues[i]). I have downloaded & compiled the Apache Tomcat 8.5.x trunk code, fixed the bug, and tested it by running my app inside the servlet, and it now correctly gives an error about it not finding the desired method that I have bound to the argument.

*IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION*:

The exception or error message should be more explicit about that EL first looks for a method by the name and then the property. I got really mad after a while wondering *WHY IS IT LOOKING FOR THE PROPERTY IF I EXPLICITLY SAID IT WAS A METHOD?!?!?*, which led to the tinkering with the signature, which led to the small bug discovery. It's just that it's not obvious (from outside) what Tomcat is doing and I think it would be nice to indicate that somehow."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60844

I'm not exactly sure what's causing that, but IBM JDK is weird so...

Steps to reproduce:

1. ./catalina.sh start -security

2. Make a request:

I narrowed down the problem to an unexpected access denial exception being returned from OutputBuffer:583:

I added a try/catch and e.printStackTrace() and found the following exception happens within the encoders.get() call on line 583 ONLY when using IBM JDK:

Knowing the exception it was pretty easy to fix with a policy update, but I'm opening this bug because I don't know if this is feasible or not (I don't know the security policy well enough). Changing the catalina.policy's RuntimePermissions on the org.apache.tomcat package from:

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.76 (markt)|fix|60718|Improve error handling for asynchronous processing and correct a number of cases where the requestDestroyed() event was not being fired and an entry wasn't being made in the access logs. (markt)|requestDestroyed not called for asynchronous after I/O error|"Sequence of events:
1. Servlet ""synchronously"" writes an async response: ac = req.startAsync(); try { resp.getOutputStream().write(new byte[1024*1024]); } finally { ac.complete(); }
2. Client disconnects to force broken pipe (etc.): uc = new URL(""..."").openConnection(); uc.getInputStream().close(); uc.disconnect();

In this case, where ServletRequestListener.requestInitialized is called.  Summary of scenarios:
- Fail: the servlet writes the response synchronously after startAsync (described above)
- Fail: In Tomcat 8.5.11, the servlet writes the response truly asynchronously (with a new Thread)
- Pass: in Tomcat 8.5.6, the servlet writes the response truly asynchronously (with a new Thread)
- Pass: the servlet writes the response truly synchronously (without startAsync)
- Pass: the client reads the stream without disconnecting early (all Tomcat versions, regardless of other scenarios presented).

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.76 (markt)|fix|60808|Ensure that the Map returned by ServletRequest.getParameterMap() is fully immutable. Based on a patch provided by woosan. (markt)|ServletRequest.getParameterMap() not fully immutable|"A corner case was discovered: if request.getParameterMap().keySet().retainAll(set) is called even after the internal ParameterMap is locked.

Reproducible step:
- Create a simple JSP page like this:
<%
// test.jsp
out.println(""request.getParameterMap(): "" + request.getParameterMap());
request.getParameterMap().keySet().retainAll(java.util.Collections.emptySet());
out.println(""request.getParameterMap(): "" + request.getParameterMap());
%>
- Request the page. e.g, http://localhost:8080/examples/test.jsp?p1=v1&p2=v2
- You will notice the second output is empty.

According to the javadoc of javax.servlet.ServletRequest#getParameterMap(), the returned map must be immutable. But, its #keySet() seems to return a mutable set. It could have returned an unmodifiable set at least like Collections.unmodifiableMap(map) does."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60808
Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.76 (markt)|fix|60824|Correctly cache the Subject in the session - if there is a session - when running under a SecurityManager. Patch provided by Jan Engehausen. (markt)|Subject incorrectly removed from user session|"In our setup we have global security enabled, and we're using Spring Security with a pre-authenticated scenario in the web application.
We're seeing a (very likely platform-indepedent) issue with unexpected javax.security.auth.Subject instances and unexpected java.security.Principal instances contained in those Subject instances. We see each request exposes a new Subject instance, and under load (same user session, concurrent requests) a Principal created by Spring is present in the set of principals of the Subject instance, whilst the Tomcat-managed one is not present.

The problem has been observed on Linux and Windows. We're using the following Java versions:
- Linux: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
- Windows: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_31-b13)

Tomcat Connector
Linux:  <Connector URIEncoding=""UTF-8"" scheme=""http"" protocol=""HTTP/1.1"" connectionTimeout=""20000"" port=""...""/>
Windows: Embedded Tomcat 7.0.47 via Maven Tomcat plugin

Tomcat is not used behind Apache HTTPD or any other web server.

We have debugged the issue and believe the cause lies in org.apache.catalina.connector.Request.setUserPrincipal(Principal)
The code in this method tries to cache the Subject in the user session, but (accidentally?) removes it from the session at the beginning of every request.
This is because the variable ""subject"" is always ""null"" when ""session.setAttribute(Globals.SUBJECT_ATTR, subject);"" is called, unless the session did not carry a subject yet.

Further code in Tomcat uses the session to obtain and cache the Subject in the session, e.g. org.apache.catalina.security.SecurityUtil.execute(Method, Object, Object[], Principal). In there, if no Subject is found in the session, a new instance is created with the Principal of the current request, stored in the session and used as the current JAAS subject.
Concurrent requests from the same user session may cause race conditions, as the Subject is removed from the session but also cached by these parts of the code.

We have created a simple reproduceable test, see below, which verifies that the Tomcat-managed principal is found in the Principal set of the current Subject. In error cases, only a Spring-managed Principal is found.
In our actual real-life case, our code relies on Principal objects created by a custom login module, which are sometimes not found, thus causing the real application to fail.

Overview
If global security is enabled and a session exists, the Subject is removed from the session at the beginning of each request.

Reproducer
Find details and how to run at https://github.com/smurf667/test-tomcat-broken-subject
The test setup uses an integration test with an embedded Tomcat to send a number of concurrent requests for a single user session.
A Spring filter in the application makes sure that a Tomcat-managed Principal created is present in the subject. If not, the application fails.

Expected: The Subject present for each request of the same user session contains a Tomcat-managed Principal.
Actual: Sometimes the Subject only contains a Spring-managed Principal.

We're suggesting a potential fix for the issue in the README.md of the repository.
As we're no experts, we leave it to the person handling our bug report to judge if the fix is appropriate or not (we believe so). Please ask if you have any further questions, thanks!

After upgrading a site to Tomcat 7.0.73 from 7.0.72 or from anything earlier, a url with an unencoded { or } (ie. http://my.com?filter={""search"":""isvalid""} ), now returns a 400 error code and logs the following error message:

""INFO: Error parsing HTTP request header
 Note: further occurrences of HTTP header parsing errors will be logged at DEBUG level.
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid character found in the request target. The valid characters are defined in RFC 7230 and RFC 3986""

Resolution:
Since this is a breaking change (aka regression failure), there should be an option to override and turn this off (still reporting the first occurrence as shown above), so that any existing site which experiences this can choose to ignore this failure and continue as before, so they can deal with changing their application at a later date, if they deem the security risk is appropriate.

Defaulting the option to true (to enable the check) is perfectly fine, as long as there is an option in a server and/or application config file to disable it, and proper documentation on it.

Either this, or you clearly state in the release notes of 7.0.73, exactly what will break, and recommend that users do not perform the Tomcat update, if they are not ready to change their applications to comply, but I think this would open up an even bigger can of worms.

Instead of just saying:
""Add additional checks for valid characters to the HTTP request line parsing so invalid request lines are rejected sooner. (markt)"" - this tells us nothing about the impending doom we may face.

But, I would recommend just giving us the option to decide for ourselves."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60594

WebSocket|Tomcat 7.0.76 (markt)|fix|60617|Correctly create a CONNECT request when establishing a WebSocket connection via a proxy. Patch provided by Svetlin Zarev. (markt)|WsWebSocketContainer generates bad CONNECT request when proxy is used|"Issue Description
===

WsWebSocketContainer generates bad CONNECT request when a proxy is used. The host does not contain port information, hence the app cannot connect to wss:// endpoints. Also some stricter proxy servers may reject requests without port info, thus making WsWebSocketContainer.connectToServer() fail for both ws:// and wss:// endpoints.

Steps to reproduce
===

Prerequisites
---
1. Download Tomcat 8.5.9
2. Configure it to use port 8081
3. Clone git@github.com:adamfisk/LittleProxy.git
4. Clone MCVE: git@github.com:SvetlinZarev/websocket-tomcat-bug.git
5. Build (3), (4) -> mvn clean install (you may want to rename the mcve to ROOT)

You can use any other proxy if you already have one.

How to reproduce it
---
1. Start LittleProxy (it defaults to port 8080)
2. Configure Tomcat use the proxy: export CATALINA_OPTS=""-Dhttp.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttps.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080""
3. Start tomcat: catalina.sh run
4. Request the mcve: http://localhost:8081/ws

Expected behavior
---
You should see: 

Connected. Sending message...
Message: Hello World!
Disconnected: 

Actual behavior
---
An exception is thrown. In case of LittleProxy it is a timeout exception during channel.handshake().get(); In my other case it is a DeploymentException caused by a bad request, because the (stricter) proxy rejected the request because  it does not contain port info.

Additional information
---
You can play with the mcve by adding the following request parameters:
* scheme - i.e. ws://, wss://
* server - i.e. echo.websocket.org
Request the mcve with: http://localhost:8081/ws?scheme=wss://&server=echo.websocket.org:443

It will succeed. Now remove the port from the server string. It will fail.

===

According to rfc2817 section 5.2:

    A CONNECT method requests that a proxy establish a tunnel connection on its behalf. The Request-URI portion of the Request-Line is always an 'authority' as defined by URI Generic Syntax [2], which is to say the host name and port number destination of the requested connection separated by a colon

Also by the never finalized draft https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luotonen-web-proxy-tunneling-01#section-3.1:

    The client connects to the proxy server, and uses the CONNECT method to specify the hostname and the port number to connect to. The hostname and port number are separated by a colon, and both of them must be specified"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60617

Test Case

We recently changed the way we distribute out tag libraries, and now package them within a jar file. We have a nightly deploy and test. After this change the deployed server was working fine, but the test compilation of the tag library now fails.

Attached is a cut-down test case that shows the issue. If you run

ant -Dtomcat.dir=PATH_TO_TOMCAT7

you will see the error:
build.xml:38: org.apache.jasper.JasperException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /META-INF/tags/listitems.tagx

If you take the same war file and deploy it, you can view the welcome page and the tag works as expected. You should see:

<!DOCTYPE html>

We ran into a problem when running a Struts 1 application that makes use of the Struts Nested tag library under Tomcat 8.5.5. (We have similar problems for the DisplayTag as well.) Here is a simplified example to illustrate the problem. Consider the following three simple Java classes, namely, Form.java, Parent.java, and Child.java:

public class Form {

    private List<Parent> parents;

    public List<Parent> getParents() {
        return parents;
    }

    public void setParents(List<Parent> parents) {
        this.parents = parents;
    }
}


public class Parent {
    private String name;
    private List<Child> children;

    public Parent(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {

    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public List<Child> getChildren() {
        return children;
    }

    public void setChildren(List<Child> children) {
        this.children = children;
    }
}



public class Child {
    private String name;
    private Parent parent;

    public Child(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }


    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Parent getParent() {
        return parent;
    }

    public void setParent(Parent parent) {
        this.parent = parent;
    }
}


Suppose we have two JSPs, say page1.jsp and page2.jsp, such that page1.jsp includes page2.jsp and that both page1.jsp and page2.jsp include a nested:iterate tag for rendering information contained in a Form instance.

page1.jsp
---------
<nested:iterate id=""parent"" name=""form"" property=""parents"" indexId=""id"">
   <jsp:include page=""/page2.jsp""/>
</nested:iterate>


page2.jsp
---------
<nested:iterate id=""child"" property=""children"" indexId=""id"">
   ... code that makes use of child ....
</nested:iterate>

Based on the current tag pool implementation, Tomcat will maintain two distinct tag pools for the nested:iterate tag, one for page1.jsp and the other for page2.jsp.
Under normal execution, i.e., without exception, the object referenced by the nested:iterate tag defined on page2.jsp from which the ""children"" property will be retrieved is a Parent instance, which is initialized by the nested:iterate tag defined on page1.jsp. However, if the execution of the nested:iterate tag's body defined on page2.jsp throws an exception, the name property of the tag instance will be incorrectly and permanently set to be ""form"", after the tag instance is returned back to the pool (associated with page2.jsp) to be reused.  As a result, all subsequent executions of page2.jsp that make use of the corrupted nested:iterate tag instance will throw an exception, since the Form.java class does not contain a property named ""children""."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60497

sample program

This defect is related to an issue reported previously (https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54997) .
With the above fix, although BUFFER_UNDERFLOW is being handled, there is still an issue with BUFFER_OVERFLOW. 

Issue is reproduced by using WebSocketContainer to connect to a server which requires clientcert authentication (  SSLEnabled=""true"" clientAuth=""true"" )


In this case, during the SSL handshake, when AsyncChannelWrapperSecure gets a handshakeStatus of NEED_UNWRAP, it needs to dynamically resize the DUMMY buffer, before invoking sslEngine.unwrap(socketReadBuffer, DUMMY), as recommended by http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLEngine.html . 


The handshake fails with the following error :

jdbc-pool|Tomcat 7.0.74 (violetagg)|fix|60194|If validationQuery is not specified, connection validation is done by calling the isValid() method. (kfujino)|Support for isValid, needs clarification|"It is now 2016 and most people are using Java 7 or Java 8. In Java 6 the Connection.isValid() method was introduced as a way to ""ping"" a connection. Yet, for anyone wishing to implement Tomcat JDBC Pool it will appear to them as if they'll need to figure out and configure a validation query for each type of database that they'll be using. And I guess this is true. tomcat-jdbc doesn't take advantage of Connection.isValid(). The documentation doesn't mention anything about Connection.isValid() as an alternative to custom validation queries.

Other JDBC Pools takes the approach of using Connection.isValid() if present and otherwise falling back to custom query. 

While bug 48817 discusses this issue back in 2010, I cannot really see what came out it. 

I believe there are a number of things that can be done (in order of effort):

1. Improve documentation. What are people supposed to do?  Is the recommended approach to implement a custom Validator which would then call Connection.isValid()?  

2. Perhaps include a ready-made Validator which does just that. Then people can use it simply by adding config (""show them the path"").

3. Maybe time to ditch Java 5 compatibility ?  .. meaning do what other JDBC Pools do and let Connection.isValid() be the default."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60194

This can cause issues when sub-processes are spawned. As far as I understand, the sub-process tries to use java.util.logging but throws an ClassNotFoundException because org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager is not on classpath.

This has already been solved for catalina.sh back in 2013, see bug 54601 for further explanations (https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54601)

The same issuses as described in bug 54601, with Jenkins and Gradle, are still present in the Windows version of Tomcat 8.5.8. Since the catalina.bat file looks the same in this regard for tomcat 7 and 9 it is reasonable to believe these versions are affected as well.

A solution similar to the one for catalina.sh solves the issue for me.

I would be very helpful if the log would say which attribute have caused the problem.

Sample implementation StandardSession.java in doReadObject(ObjectInputStream stream):

Instead of:

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String name = (String) stream.readObject();
            Object value = stream.readObject();

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.73 (violetagg)|fix|60123|Avoid potential threading issues that could cause excessively large vales to be returned for the processing time of a current request. (markt)|Tomcat JMX requestProcessingTime sometimes reports a request processor with decades of runtime (since 1-1-1970)|"We have an application that periodically monitors JMX ""Catalina:type=RequestProcessor,worker=*,name=*"" and looks at each entry returned from that wildcard, getting requestProcessingTime.  e.g., code with lines like this:

    ObjectName requestProcessorWildcard = new ObjectName(""Catalina:type=RequestProcessor,worker=*,name=*"");
    Set<ObjectName> mbeans = mbs.queryNames(requestProcessorWildcard, null);
    for (ObjectName name : mbeans) {
        // Get ""processing time"" for the current request, if any
        long currentReqProcTime = getLongValue(mbs, name, ""requestProcessingTime"") / 60000;

We sometimes see requestProcessingTime returning a value suggesting the request started on 1-1-1970, currently 46+ years ago.  Looking at Tomcat 7.0.57 source code (as what I have available to look at), I see this method in java/org/apache/coyote/RequestInfo.java:

    public long getRequestProcessingTime() {
        if ( getStage() == org.apache.coyote.Constants.STAGE_ENDED ) return 0;
        else return (System.currentTimeMillis() - req.getStartTime());
    }

Clearly, if req.getStartTime() == 0, this method will return a nonsensical request processing time.  This method ought to make sure the start time isn't zero before doing the subtraction.  When we see this, the request processor reports itself to be in stage 3 ... aka ""STAGE_SERVICE"".  Clearly the requests weren't started in 1970.  We don't know how the request is in the stage ""service"" but has its start time zeroed.

Note that the person in this thread http://osdir.com/ml/users-tomcat.apache.org/2016-06/msg00204.html was probably experiencing the same flaw.  If you do the math 1466499689496 msec corresponds to the time span from 1-1-70 to Tue, 21 Jun 2016 09:01:29.496 GMT ... and the EMail was posted on 21 June 2016!

Test class

When the StatementCache is searching for a matching PreparedStatement, the matching criteria do not take into account the scrollable type of result set, but only the sql query.

If we create a PreparedStatement with a FORWARD_ONLY result set type, and then we try to create another PreparedStatement with a SCROLL_INSENSITIVE type with the same query, then the cache will return the PreparedStatement created first(a FORWARD_ONLY statement), and any attempt to call the absolute method will throw a java.sql.SQLException: The 'absolute()' method is only allowed on scroll cursors.

Please find attached a Test Class that can help to reproduce the problem. To run this class you need to add derby-10.11, tomcat-jdbc-8.0.37 and tomcat-juli-8.0.37 to classpath. I am using jdk1.8.0_92 to compile and execute this test.

P.S. The error only appears when creating a PreparedStatement instead of a Statement (by calling createStatement()).

Please tell me, if you need more informations.

(fschumacher)|roleSearchAsUser not applied to nested roles when roleNested enabled|"When using a JNDIRealm to search for a user's roles recursively via the 'roleNested' option while also binding using that user's credentials via the 'roleSearchAsUser' option, only the first role search actually binds using the user's credentials.  Subsequent searches of the nested roles revert to the original security environment, which leads to a NamingException reporting that a successful bind must be completed first (see below).

The cause is straightforward, from looking at the code.  I will refer to the code for 7.0.68, as that is what I've tested against, but I also see the same issue in the code for 7.0.70 and 8.5.3.  In ""JNDIRealm.java"" and the method getRoles() (starting on line 1938), there are two calls to context.search().  The first call on line 2002 is wrapped in logic which adds the user's credentials beforehand and removes them afterward, if 'roleSearchAsUser' was specified.  The second call on line 2056 is not wrapped in the same logic, but I'm guessing it should be.  This second call is only reached if 'roleNested' is true, per the if-block starting on line 2039.

The net result is that when anonymous binding is not allowed, the first search succeeds (assuming the user entered the correct credentials) and then the second one fails with a stack trace like the following.  I've redacted the company name and info:

javax.naming.NamingException: [LDAP: error code 1 - 000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C0906E8, comment: In order to perform this operation a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, v1db1"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59839

This happens in two situations:

1. When Tomcat tries to find classes to cache. The code in problem is at Line 2275 in [1]. It calls the webapp classloader's getResourceAsStream() method and eventually ends up doing a lookup in WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/resources for many Java class.

2. When Tomcat tries to load some classes using the webapp classloader, the classloader's findClassInternal() calls its findResourceInternal() method, which may do a lookup in its repository (aka WEB-INF/classes), see Line 3291 in [2].

The code actually does the lookup in the WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/resources is at Line 502 in [3]. The above situations can be easily observed by setting a breakpoint at this line and then start tomcat in debug mode with all the default configurations (addWebinfClassesResources is false, though even if it's set to true the above behavior is wrong).

This same issue may exist in Tomcat 8 and onwards as well.

(markt)|NPE in WebappClassLoaderBase|"After deploy war in tomcat, delete the jar in WEB-INF/lib/, then it may throws NullPointerException when load class


The reason as follow:

WebappClassLoaderBase (between line 3093 and 3110 in method openJARs())

    protected boolean openJARs() {
        if (started && (jarFiles.length > 0)) {
            lastJarAccessed = System.currentTimeMillis();
            if (jarFiles[0] == null) {
                for (int i = 0; i < jarFiles.length; i++) {
                    try {
                        jarFiles[i] = new JarFile(jarRealFiles[i]);
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
                            log.debug(""Failed to open JAR"", e);
                        }
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }


If IOException is thrown in line 3099, the jarFiles will be [file1,file2,NULL,NULL,...]. after that, it will return true when invoke openJARs(), beacuse jarFiles[0] != null. 


WebappClassLoaderBase (between line 3271 and 3285 in method openJARs())

            if (openJARs()) {
                for (int i = 0; i < jarFiles.length; i++) {

                    jarEntry = jarFiles[i].getJarEntry(jarEntryPath);

                    if (jarEntry != null) {
                        try {
                            entry.manifest = jarFiles[i].getManifest();
                        } catch (IOException ioe) {
                            // Ignore
                        }
                        break;
                    }
                 }
             }



beacuse jarFiles=[file1,file2,NULL,NULL,...], so jarFiles[i] may be null, This will cause NullPointerException in line 3274. In this case, it is difficult to judge what went wrong.

It doesn't seem to be possible to configure the response code for the http -> https redirect. 

Discussions with Google webmasters reveal that Google require a 301 moved permanently response to the http -> https redirect. This is key to maintaining existing rankings

Our application relies on initSQL to set the current_schema on each JDBC connection. We noticed that when our application is under heavy load (maxActive DB connections), the application sometimes gets handed a connection that did not have initSQL executed on it.

We had a look at the ConnectionPool.java source code (TOMCAT_7_0_57 and trunk) and found that there is a scenario where the pool creates a new connection without running `PooledConnection#validate(PooledConnection.VALIDATE_INIT)` on it.

To reproduce this issue, two conditions need to coincide:

1) The server has to be under load. The pool needs to be saturated to the point where no new connections get created for incoming requests (requests > maxActive). Threads block on the 'idle' queue/the waitcount atomic is > 0.

2) Active connections need to be released from the pool (unhandled exceptions, maxAge, suspectTimeout etc.)

Under load, the ConnectionPool#release method will create an 'ad-hoc' connection to replace the active connection it just removed from the ConnectionPool:

if (waitcount.get() > 0) {
   idle.offer(create(true));
} 

The #connect call for a PooledConnection object created this way follows in #borrowConnection instead of #createConnection. In #borrowConnection there is no call to #validate(VALIDATE_INIT) before that 'ad-hoc' connection is returned to the requesting thread.

Our best ""workaround"" at the moment: 
 - Use a validationQuery that fails when initSQL was not run
 - enable testOnBorrow
 - validationInterval at 1ms

The short validation interval is necessary because the 'ad-hoc' connection object will have its lastValidation time stamp set to currentTimeMillis on object creation, causing it to skip onBorrow validation immediately after it is being created.

Needless to say this workaround comes at a significant performance cost to the entire application (short validationInterval) in addition to creating those uninitialized DB connections just to throw them away immediately when they inevitably fail onBorrow validation."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59849

http://tomcat.10.x6.nabble.com/Question-about-suspectTimeout-property-of-pool-configuration-possible-Bug-does-only-work-with-removed-td5054070.html

If you configure the pool to have:

 logAbandoned=""true""
 suspectTimeout=""120""

set it does not report leaked connections even if you got leaked connections hanging in the busy queue.
To me this looks like a bug.

Docs tell this:


  Similar to to the removeAbandonedTimeout value but instead of treating
  the connection as abandoned, and potentially closing the connection,
  this simply logs the warning if logAbandoned is set to true.


Looking at the code however the suspect() method of a connection is only called from the PoolCleaner thread in the ""checkAbandoned()"" method.

But before calling that one it does check the pool configuration like this:

if (pool.getPoolProperties().isRemoveAbandoned())
                        pool.checkAbandoned();

but i don't want to configure removeAbandoned to true - i just want to get the suspect working like expected from reading the documentation of the property without actually removing the leaked connections.

Imho this needs to be changed - either the condition here is extended to look for suspectTimeout or the suspect is called in an extra method - i don't care which one is used ;)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60043

processing. Basically, Tomcat should ensure that the AsyncListener onError
and onComplete methods are correctly called if an exception occurs during
async processing in order to allow the listener code to release resources
and do clean-up. This does not seem to happen.

A sample servlet demonstrating the problem, AsyncDebugListener, is provided 
at the following location:

https://github.com/msnicklous/AsyncDebug

Build the AsyncDebugListener module using 'mvn install' and deploy it on Tomcat.

The service method and each of the AsyncListener methods logs output to the
AsyncListener.log file. You can follow execution by looking at the logs.

Assuming Tomcat is installed locally, you can use the following URLs:

1) No error - works correctly:

http://localhost:8080/AsyncDebugListener/ltest?reps=3

2) Exception during service method

http://localhost:8080/AsyncDebugListener/ltest?err

If async processing is started and an exception is thrown before the end of
the service method, AsyncListener#onError is not called, however onTimeout
followed by onComplete are both called. 

This is incorrect, as onError followed by onComplete should be called. 

3) Exception during processing of AsyncContext#dispatch() target

http://localhost:8080/AsyncDebugListener/ltest?reps=3&err

Precondition: Async processing is started and the request is dispatched using 
AsyncContext#dispatch(). The service method returns to the container.

If the container performs the resulting async dispatch and an exception is 
thrown, Tomcat drops the connection to the browser and no AsyncListener method
is called.

This is incorrect. Tomcat should flush the contents of the buffer to the 
browser and call the AsyncListener onError followed by the onComplete methods.

Non-async requests don't cause any problem. I use Spring Framework 4.2.5.

Debugging revealed what happens:

URI constructor expects an escaped URI (/api/alarms/foo%20bar). When AsyncDispatcher runs, it passes a ServletRequest implementation which getRequestURI() returns /api/alarms/foo bar. Non-async request handling passes an implementation that returns the escaped URI.

AsyncContextImpl.dispatch() constructs a path from HttpServletRequest.getServletPath() and getPathInfo().
This path is used in ApplicationContext.getRequestDispatcher() where ApplicationDispatcher constructor is called with the path where it a request URI is expected.

Later ApplicationDispatcher.wrapRequest() creates an ApplicationHttpRequest with a correct request URI but ApplicationDispatcher.doDispatch() calls wrequest.setRequestURI() passing a path not a URI.

As result the servlet handling the request receives an ApplicationHttpRequest with an incorrect requestURI field ( identical to servletPath field), despite including a RequestFacade in the request field that returns the correct (escaped) value in getRequestURI().

Using connector NIO, current connector configuration:
    <Connector port=""8001"" protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol""
        connectionTimeout=""20000""
        acceptorThreadCount=""4""

Hardware: different servers, Intel Xeon CPU with a total of 16 core (32 thread) memory per tomcat around 30GB, using G1GC.
==============================
What is happening:
Before the update, with Tomcat version 8.0.27, we didn't have any issue with the NIO connector, it was working fine and websocket too.
Since the update, the connector just ""crash"" after several hours of work: no request are then processed (websocket or http), trying to access any application from http://ip:8001/ just hangs. Looking at the state of the network socket, it is clearly not working (graph attached).

The http/NIO connector is used almost exclusively for websocket connections (the only connection that are not websocket are from our internal connector checker).

There is also an AJP/APR connector that is working fine during that time, even when the NIO/http connector crash.

I don't see anything in the catalina.out nor in the system log... 

I know this is difficult to debug with so little information, I only see this issue in production myself when there is a large number of connections, never in test.

The tomcat is behind an apache httpd 2.4 proxy, relevant configuration:
JkMount /APPNAME* server_tomcat1
ProxyPass /APPNAME/realtime/ ws://server.example.net:8001/APPNAME/realtime/

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.70 (violetagg)|fix|59289|Do not recycle upgrade processors in unexpected close situations. (remm)|Upgrade processor is put in recycledProcessors stack of Http11NioProtocol.Http11ConnectionHandler|"We're using Tomcat in our product and facing issues with a few HTTP requests under traffic. Basically what happens is that incoming HTTP connection is terminated by Tomcat (TCP FIN or TCP RST packet is sent) right after HTTPS handshake is finished.

Each traffic iteration consists of the following:

1) 2000 Websocket connections used to pass data between the clients.
2) Some minor supporting HTTP traffic.

In the end of traffic iteration Websocket sessions are closing and, at the same time, some supporting HTTP traffic is processed by Tomcat. I was adding various logs to the Tomcat code and figured out that Tomcat attempts to process these failing HTTP requests with Upgrade processors (org.apache.coyote.http11.upgrade.NioProcessor).

I added the following logs:
1) AbstractProtocol.AbstractConnectionHandler.process right after processor is identified:

                if (processor.isUpgrade()) {
                   getLog().info(""AbstractConnectionHandler.process got processor from "" + processorSource + 
                         "". status = "" + status.name() + 
                         "", processor.id = "" + processor.getId());
                }

2) Http11NioProtocol.Http11ConnectionHandler.release (both, right before processor is recycled)

               if (processor.getId()  == -2) {
                  getLog().info(""Recycling upgrade processor in HTTP protocol.\n"", new Exception());
               }

note that I adde method getId to all processors. For regular HTTP processors it equals to request ID (which I also added). For upgrade processor (org.apache.coyote.http11.upgrade.NioProcessor) ID always equal to -2.

and here is the output I got right before failed HTTP request:

INFO: AbstractConnectionHandler.process got processor from recycledProcessors map. status = OPEN_READ, processor.id = -2

So, what happens is - Poller adds NioProcessor to recycledProcessors stack of Http11NioProtocol.Http11ConnectionHandler and next HTTP request to Tomcat which is coming in is failing because Tomcat attempts to process it with NioProcessor instead of regular Http11NioProcessor.

If any additional logs are required to reproduce the issue  - please let me know. It seems like during normal operation such NioProcessors are just removed from commections map, for example here in AbstractProtocol.AbstractConnectionHandler.process method:
                    // Connection closed. OK to recycle the processor. Upgrade
                    // processors are not recycled.
                    connections.remove(socket);
                    if (processor.isUpgrade()) {
...

and are never expected to be recycled. And in case CancelledKeyException is thrown in Poller there's no check for upgrade processors and upgrade processor can be recycled."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59289

Conclusion:
Clearly the tomcat 7 behavior is against spec, which I think should be fixed.


Analysis:
After some digging, I found that the tld file is skipped during tld scan phase. However, when parsing tag lib directive, the org.apache.jasper.compiler.TagLibraryInfoImpl#generateTLDLocation didn't check the tld file location that is prohibited by spec.
Since the implementation is quite different between tomcat 7 % tomcat 8+. I found it hard to backport the tomcat 8 implementation to tomcat 7. Therefore, the fix should be specific to tomcat 7(tomcat 6 is not investigated.)


Proposed Fix:
Please refer to the attachment.
I've added a dedicated message to indicate such an behaivor is violating spec.

p.s. 
Should we also add the dedicated message to tomcat 8+ ? Because the message ""Unable to find taglib ""f"" for URI: /WEB-INF/tags/test.tld""  is somewhat confusing. The file does exist, it is the spec that requires tomcat not to load it."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59654

- getUserBySearch, line 1685
- getRoles, line 1974
- addAttributeValues, line 2125

(this is from trunk, I saw the same issue in Tomcat 8, I suspect the problem is the same for all the tomcat versions)

The problem is that if a NamingEnumeration is not close, then the associated DirContext won't be closed, even if a DirContext.close() is explicitly called, leving the DirContext opened until it times out. The consequence is that if this DirContext is taken from a Pool of connection, you pretty quickly exhaust this pool, as the connction will be back into the available connections only when they timeout (an dthe default timeout is 30s, from the top of my head).

This is explicitely said on https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/ldap/close.html :

""You invoke Context.close() on a Context instance to indicate that you no longer need to use it. If the Context instance being closed is using a dedicated connection, the connection is also closed. If the Context instance is sharing a connection with other Context and unterminated NamingEnumeration instances, the connection will not be closed until close() has been invoked on all such Context and NamingEnumeration instances.""

(markt)|checkThreadLocalMapForLeaks has false positives|"ThreadLocal$ThreadLocalMap weakly references keys but strongly references values.  However, it appears the checkThreadLocalMapForLeaks checking reports false positives if the key is a ThreadLocal subclass (e.g., anonymous class) but the value does not strongly reference the class loader (e.g., Integer, int[], List<SimpleDateFormatter>, etc.).  Example output:

07-Mar-2016 11:27:08.258 SEVERE [localhost-startStop-2] org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoaderBase.checkThreadLocalMapForLeaks The web application [servlettest-0.1] created a ThreadLocal with key of type [servlettest.TestServlet$1] (value [servlettest.TestServlet$1@40d92399]) and a value of type [java.lang.Integer] (value [1]) but failed to remove it when the web application was stopped. Threads are going to be renewed over time to try and avoid a probable memory leak.

For large web applications with many such false positives, this output makes tracking down (or even noticing new) real issues more difficult.  Third party libraries refuse to adjust their use of ThreadLocal because they believe (IMO rightly) their code is not causing leaks.  I have read bug 50175 comment 6, but given that the current heuristic has false positives, can some compromise be reached?  Perhaps some configuration for stifling the warning on a per key class name basis could be added?

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.69 (violetagg)|fix|59213|Async dispatches should be based off a wrapped request. (remm)|Async dispatch not working after cross-context forward|"I ran into this problem while working on the Apache Pluto project, which makes use of async features. I boiled it down to come up with two test servlets that are available here:

https://github.com/msnicklous/AsyncDebug

I have reproduced the problem on both Tomcat 8.0.28 and 8.0.32.

Problem description:

Given Servlet1 and Servlet2 running in separate servlet contexts.

Servlet1 contains the following code:

   PrintWriter writer = resp.getWriter(); 
   writer.append(""<h3>Async Debug1</h3>""); 
   AsyncContext actx = req.startAsync(req, resp);
   actx.dispatch(""/WEB-INF/jsp/debug1.jsp"");

When Servlet1 is accessed directly, the header ""Async Debug 1"" along with the
contents of debug1.jsp is displayed properly.

Servlet2 contains the following code:

   ServletContext ctx1 = req.getServletContext().getContext(""/AsyncDebug1"");
   RequestDispatcher rd = ctx1.getRequestDispatcher(""/Debug"");
   rd.forward(req, resp);

Servlet2 performs a cross-context forward to Servlet1. The Servlet2 web module
contains a context.xml file that enables cross-context support.

When Servlet2 is accessed, the header ""Async Debug 1"" is displayed, but the
contents of debug1.jsp is not displayed. Also, the log contains the following
message:

22-Mar-2016 08:47:58.875 SEVERE [http-apr-8080-exec-2]
org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.handleMissingResource File
[/WEB-INF/jsp/debug1.jsp] not found

I think this is incorrect behavior. Since Servlet1 initializes the AsyncContext,
this behavior would seen to contradict the Servlet Specification 3.1, page 15
where the description for the AsyncContext#dispatch(String path) method states:
""The given path is interpreted as relative to the ServletContext that
initialized the AsyncContext."". 

Additional info: 

by hacking around, I noticed that changing the Servlet1 dispatch call as follows causes the async dispatch to work even when Servlet1 is
accessed through a cross-context forward:

   actx.dispatch(req.getServletContext(), ""/WEB-INF/jsp/debug1.jsp"");
   
where 'req' is the HttpServletRequest.

(markt)|Session swapping out in PersistentManagerBase|"I've been trying to setup PersistentManager, more precisely I wanted to configure session swapping out to achieve memory friendly configuration under high load.
To my surprise, this is not possible, or I must be missing something crucial.

Swapping out only works, when the session is idle for too long. However, it does not work together with the 'maxActiveSessions' configuration option.

Method processMaxActiveSwaps()
------------------------------
In the org.apache.catalina.session.PersistentManagerBase, there is method called processMaxActiveSwaps(), which should do the 'maxActiveSessions' checking and swap out superfluous sessions. However, the method body never executes:

Compare the condition ""if (getMaxActiveSessions() >= sessions.length) return;"" with the fact, that exception is thrown if too many sessions are created in org.apache.catalina.session.ManagerBase.createSession().


I've found this bug in versions 7, 8, 9. Seems that this bug is there since ages, the same already reported here (in 2001!!!):
https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/tomcat-dev/200112.mbox/%3C3C20D8AE.D9B7795F@distributopia.com%3E
https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/tomcat-dev/200112.mbox/<3C20D8AE.D9B7795F@distributopia.com>


Expected behaviour
------------------
Just to eliminate possible misunderstandings, here is what behaviour I expected from the documentation, the source code and what common sence tells me: there is configuration option 'maxActiveSessions' which simply limits number of sessions stored in the memory, to avoid OutOfMemExeption etc. However, I have session timeout set up for couple of hours (needed) and it is not possible to keep them all in memory. And I don't even want to tell to my users: Sorry, no space for you, here you have it: TooManyActiveSessionsException on you. So I'd like to swap out sessions not active for say half an hour. There is 'minIdleSwap' config option, which tells when the session may be swapped out if needed. BTW. as this does not work, this option is currently completely useless.

What can be done: remove the check in org.apache.catalina.session.ManagerBase.createSession() (or make it less strict - e.g. allow couple of additional sessions to be created over this limit). Then the processMaxActiveSwaps() method would do its job nicely and overflowing sessions would be swapped out.


Many thanks for 1) any clarification if I'm wrong OR 2) bug fixing :-) OR 3) removing the stale/old/never-more-working source code and documenting that this feature is simply not there even though it looks like it is."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59269

We have several applications deployed on our Tomcat. Most of the applications are simple Jersey Rest service applications. Above NullPointer is related to one of them (basically, the one which is called during traffic - I bet other apps will have the same issue if they would be called). Also we have one application which is using WebSockets (Tomcat implementation) and Async support for Comet. WebSocket interface is used during traffic testing while Comet is NOT (Servlets are not called). We have the following in our Tomcat main web.xml file (comparing to the default one):

I tried to remove async-supported from all our web.xml files and the issue is gone. So it's definitely related to <async-supported> configuration - without even actually using async functionality. We still need async-supported for our Comet interface so just disabling async is not an option for us.

I can turn on some additional logging and reproduce again if this will help - just let me know which logging is needed."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58646

WebSocket|Tomcat 7.0.69 (violetagg)|fix|59014|Ensure that a WebSocket close message can be sent after a close message has been received. (markt)|No CloseMessage because of WebSocket connection has been closed|"In our test-cases we would like to handle 

Endpoint.onClose(Session session, CloseReason closeReason) {}

But looks the code isn't reachable.

WsSession does:

  state = State.CLOSED_SENT;

...

  sendCloseMessage(closeReasonMessage);

Where we have the code like in WsRemoteEndpointImplBase.startMessageBlock:

    FutureToSendHandler f2sh = new FutureToSendHandler(wsSession);
    startMessage(opCode, payload, last, f2sh);
    try {
        if (timeout == -1) {
            f2sh.get();
        } else {
            f2sh.get(timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    }

That f2sh.get() does this:

    wsSession.registerFuture(this);

where:

    if (isOpen()) {
         futures.put(f2sh, f2sh);

    }
is false because our state is State.CLOSED_SENT not like:

    state == State.OPEN || state == State.SENDING_CLOSED

Therefore we never get result from that Future and our onClose() test fail.

(markt)|Improper forced reading causing client read timeout|"In source code [1], the ""forceRead"" section (from Line 265 to 273, as of today) does not reset ""forceRead"" to false after a forced read. This causes improper forced reading in follow-up loops even though there are still data in the socketChannel left over from last unwrap. As a result, it causes timeout in the WsWebSocketContainer.processResponse() method, and prevents websocket hand-shaking from completion.

Looking at network traffic shows that the proxy connect request is sent, proxy connection is established and then a plain GET request is sent instead of the SSL handshake.

Debugging in the WsWebSocketContainer::connectToServer() shows that there is a secure flag, to indicate whether an SSL connection is needed, but it never gets true when the connection is through a proxy.

WebSocket|Tomcat 7.0.69 (violetagg)|fix|59189|Explicitly release the native memory held by the Inflater and Deflater when using PerMessageDeflate and the WebSocket session ends. Based on a patch by Henrik Olsson. (markt)|PerMessageDeflate leaves native memory allocated unnecessarily|"During websocket load tests we noticed that the resident memory usage of the tomcat process would grow and stay in use even after the sockets were closed when websocket compression was enabled. The java heap looked fine. It seems to be caused by PerMessageDeflate creating a Deflater and Inflater which in turn allocates native memory that isn't freed until the JVM decides to run their finalizers, which can take a long time before it happens.

I propose calling .end() (which is what finalize() does) on the Deflater and Inflater when the websocket is closed. I have created a patch that does this and resident memory usage shrinks after the websockets are closed down with it.

The reason was that we added -Duser.dir=<customDir> to give Tomcat a uniqe working dir. Within our <customDir> there was a directory which was not accessible for the tomcat user. It belongs to root and no one else has access. So tomcat tries to scan the user.dir and tries to list files within the restricted dir. 

Doing so ths file.listFiles() command retuns null (instead of a list of files) which is not correctly handled and causing this Nullpointer and preventing the Server from startup.

to recrate set -Duser.dir in setenv.sh to /tmp, create a folder /tmp/test, give permission 700 to /tmp/test, chwon root:root /tmp/test and start a tomcat with at least one application and a user other than root.

The fix would be to correctly handle nullpointers or to simply write a meningfull log message.

(kkolinko)|Message about failure to load ApplicationContextFacadeBeanInfo class when running with SecurityManager enabled|"I noted this while testing 7.0.62 release candidate, but this is reproducible with 7.0.61 as well, so it is not a regression.

The issue does not happen when running with Java 8u45.
The issue does not happen when running with Java 7u80.
The issue DOES happen when running with Java 6u45 (Windows 7).

So it depends on version of JRE.

Steps:
1. Get a clean copy of Tomcat 7
2. Set JAVA_HOME = jdk 6u45
3. Start with SecurityManager enabled  (catalina.bat start -security)
4. Access http://localhost:8080/
5. An INFO message with a stacktrace of java.security.AccessControlException is logged by WebappClassLoader to catalina.yyyy-mm-dd.log, as well as console.

I do not notice any user-visible consequences from the above. The index page shows successfully. Generated HTML is the same as when running without security manager.

The examples web application works successfully.

The message is only logged on the first access to index page of ROOT web application after Tomcat start. It is not logged on reloads of the page.

It is not logged for examples web application. If I restart Tomcat and walk around examples, there is no message. Once I visit the index page the message is logged.

I tried to workaround the issue by adding the following attribute to JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener class in server.xml [1]:

classesToInitialize=""org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationContextFacadeBeanInfo""

to preload that class. The workaround did not help. The behaviour with Java 6u45 has not changed.

Test class for StandardJarScanner

An application was created with Tomcat 8 and Apache Felix both embedded on the same JVM. Apache felix happens to add a URL to the application classloader's classpath via it's extension manager, which is used to support bundle fragment/extension features of the OSGi spec:

https://github.com/apache/felix/blob/ac5ec40ee40ec92dc8124e22afa855ab2c4a850f/framework/src/main/java/org/apache/felix/framework/ExtensionManager.java#L106

When Tomcat is started on the same JVM and a context is created, Tomcat will attempt to perform a jar scan on the classloader's classpath. It will call getURLs to enumerate all classpath URLs and peek inside for pluggability purposes:

https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/scan/StandardJarScanner.java#L221

For each URL enumerated from the classloader Tomcat attempts to transform it into a ClassPathEntry. For the special URL that Apache Felix adds, ClassPathEntry's getName method will return the empty string, as there is no file part in the URL itself:

https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/scan/StandardJarScanner.java#L353

There is no way to prevent this issue with a JarScanFilter, since the check method called here will use the empty string file name, which can't be matched using the glob matching algorithm:

https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/scan/StandardJarScanner.java#L237

Eventually this falls through to the process() method through this call:
https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/scan/StandardJarScanner.java#L244

Since the URL ""http://felix.extensions:9/"" has a compatible scheme (http) but no file part (it doesn't match the jar extension) we fall through to the else condition in the process method, which will attempt to call new File(new URL(""http://felix.extensions:9"")) and fail, because the File(URL) constructor requires that the URL start with ""file:/"":

https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/trunk/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/scan/StandardJarScanner.java#L317

This has the effect of bailing out the entire webapp loading.

Steps to reproduce:
I've created a test case which demonstrates the bug. I added this test case to TestStandardJarScanner to validate against 9.0 TRUNK, though the original bug was found on tomcat 8x.

For convenience i've attached a copy of the test class with this test case embedded in it.

    /**
     * Tomcat should ignore URLs which do not have a file part and do not use the file scheme.
     */
    @Test
    public void skipsInvalidClasspathURLNoFilePartNoFileScheme() {
        StandardJarScanner scanner = new StandardJarScanner();
        LoggingCallback callback = new LoggingCallback();
        TesterServletContext context = new TesterServletContext() {
            @Override
            public ClassLoader getClassLoader() {
                URLClassLoader urlClassLoader;
                try
                {
                    urlClassLoader = new URLClassLoader(new URL[] { new URL(""http://felix.extensions:9/"") });
                }
                catch (MalformedURLException e)
                {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
                return urlClassLoader;
            }
        };
        scanner.scan(JarScanType.PLUGGABILITY, context, callback);
    }

WORKAROUNDS:
1. Disable classpath scanning in context.xml. This is a bit cumbersome for war files which contain their own context.xml as it requires a rebuild of all those downstream modules.
2. Add a LifecycleListener to hook into context creation events before they are initialized and set the jar filter to ignore empty string file names (due to the missing file name part of the class path entry)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58692

The logs for the tomcat reloading bug.

My company uses a custom inhouse tomcat library for hotloading generated source into tomcat at runtime. This custom classloader requires tomcat's JSP engine to perform a reload, so that it can recognize the newly generated classes. We are performing the following code to facilitate this:


    Context context = this.getContext();
    Wrapper jspWrapper = (Wrapper)context.findChild(""jsp"");
    
    // There might not be any jsps if we're just getting started.
    if (jspWrapper==null) return;

    jspWrapper.unload();
    jspWrapper.load();


This code works just fine on Tomcat 6. However, when migrating this custom classloader to Tomcat 8, a subsequent JSP page load fails with the attached stacktrace.

I have investigated this stack trace and come to the conclusion that, in StandardWrapper.java on line 1473, although the instance itself is set to null, the field ""instanceInitialized"" is still set to true. This means that my next call to load will recreate the JspServlet, but it will not be initialized correctly, thus causing the error in the attached stacktrace. I have seen in the debugger that it is indeed the case that the JspServlet is not being initialized properly.

A fix for this bug is to simply add this line:

instanceInitialized = false;

to line 1474 in StandardWrapper.java.

I have successfully been able to work around this bug in my own code with the following hack:

    Context context = this.getContext();
    Wrapper jspWrapper = (Wrapper)context.findChild(""jsp"");
    
    // There might not be any jsps if we're just getting started.
    if (jspWrapper==null) return;

    jspWrapper.unload();
    
    // tomcat-catalina 8.0.29
    // This custom hack is required to fix a bug in the StandardWrapper catalina sourcecode. This custom field in their source was not reset back to false
    // after calling unload, so the underlying JspServlet (the instance) did not get initialized properly upon calling load.
    // This bug happens in tomcat 7 and 8.
    AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Boolean>() {
      public Boolean run() {
        try
        {
          Field field = ((StandardWrapper)jspWrapper).getClass().getDeclaredField(""instanceInitialized"");
          field.setAccessible(true);
          field.setBoolean(jspWrapper, false);
        }
        catch (NoSuchFieldException | SecurityException | IllegalArgumentException | IllegalAccessException e)
        {
          throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }

        return Boolean.TRUE;
      }
    });
    
    
    jspWrapper.load();

war file to demo the issue

When a client aborts a request to a web application before the response is written no line is written to the Tomcat access log.

I most recently tested this on an out-of-the-box 8.0.30 distribution but I have seen the problem occur on Tomcat 8.0.28 and 7.0.39 as well.

I believe that the general repro steps are as simple as this:

1) In a browser, hit any endpoint in a web application that has an AccessLogValve configured
2) Close the browser tab that made the request before the request finishes
3) Check the access log and note that no access log line was written for the request

Demo app:
I've attached a WAR file with a simple web application to demonstrate the problem. The source code for the application is included in the WAR.

The demo application has two servlets, one ""fast"" and one ""slow"". They both log a unique ID for the request to a logback-configured application log, then return a 200 response with a simple string. The only difference between them is that the fast servlet returns immediately while the slow servlet sleeps for 30 seconds before returning.

The unique request ID generated by these servlets is also added as a request attribute so that it can be shown in the access log.

Repro steps with the demo app:
1) Put the WAR file into a Tomcat container and load it.
2) Open a web browser and go to localhost:<port>/missing-access-log-demo/fast
3) Check the application and access logs at <catalina-base>/logs/missing-access-log-demo. Note that both logs generated a line for the request, and that the unique identifier for the request is the same in both files.
4) In a web browser, go to localhost:<port>/missing-access-log-demo/slow. Watch the application log as you make the request and you should see a line quickly added with the request's unique ID.
5) Before the request completes, close the browser tab that made the request.
6) Wait 30 seconds and watch the access log. Note that no line for this request is ever added.

Expected result:

Even if the client never gets the response, a request was processed by the server so I would expect to see it appear in the access logs.

Details:
I've stepped into the Tomcat code and it seems pretty clear this is happening in the CoyoteAdapter class:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/tc8.0.x/tags/TOMCAT_8_0_30/java/org/apache/catalina/connector/CoyoteAdapter.java?view=markup

On line 558 the CoyoteAdapter calls response.finishResponse, right before the code that will call the access log. If the client is gone the finishResponse method throws an IOException when trying to flush its OutputBuffer. This exception causes the code to skip the call to context.logAccess and is then swallowed and ignored by the subsequent catch block."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58702

Sample the reproduces the problem

This problem's probably most easily described with the attached sample. There's a servlet mapped to /error and a custom error page registered with /error as it's location. Another servlet is mapped to /timeout. It deliberately allows an async request to timeout and then calls response.sendError(503).

My expectation is that this will result in the request being routed to the error servlet and that, as a result, a 503 response will be returned with ""Error!"" in the body.

The actual outcome is that a 500 response is returned with ""Error!"" in the body:

$ curl -i localhost:8080/timeout
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Content-Length: 7

(markt)|Default behavior change in tomcat 8.0.29-30 context root redirect process|"Changes to tomcat 8.0.29-30 break applications that modify attributes on the HttpSession object on the initial root context url request, and possibly other places.  This behavior change is partially described in bug 58660.

Behaviors seen:

In 8.0.28, a request to the application context ""/context"" would result in a redirect to ""/context/"".  This handling was handed in a way that was invisible to the application code.  

In 8.0.29, this request is processed and the application generates a response.

In 8.0.30, this request is processed by the application, but generates a 302 to ""/context/""

8.0.29-30 both break my application in similar but distinct ways.  The cause is that the application processes the initial request in a filter, modifies the session object, and then issues a redirect to itself.  Because the JSESSION cookie path is set to ""/context/"" and not ""/context"", the session seen on the subsequent handling of the redirect does not have access to the same session object as on the first request.  In a real application that depends on similar behavior this breaks the application in significant ways.

Another way to think of this is that it shouldn't be possible for the application to access an HttpSession that doesn't match the browser's session cookie.  As of 8.0.30 this implied contract is broken because on the initial request to the ""/context"" url, application code has access to an effectively bogus HttpSession instance.

I have created a test application that shows the different behaviors:

https://github.com/jrivard/tomcat-root-redir-test

The behavior can be reverted to the 8.0.28 style by setting the context parameter mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled=true.

I recommend the default of this setting - or some other equivalent - be changed to false.  

This issue can also be corrected by changing the context parameter sessionCookiePathUsesTrailingSlash=false, however this has a potentially negative security impact so I don't think this default should be changed.

In any case, the default behavior for this execution path should not be changing  on point releases.  My understanding is there is a similar issue in the 7.x and 9.x branch but I haven't tested them."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58765

I assume it's related to exploding the war file.

JConsole screen while observing this behavior

## Reproduction steps ##

To reproduce this issue:

1. Add undeployOldVersions=""true"" to the otherwise default Host configuration in server.xml

2. Do a parallel deployment of two versions of the same war by creating a symlink to the actual war file(s):

$ ln -s /path/to/app.war /path/to/webapps/app#001.war
$ ln -s /path/to/app.war /path/to/webapps/app#002.war

Shortly after startup, Tomcat undeploys app##001 (the ""old version""). However, the war file is not deleted, and ends up getting redeployed. This happens over and over again, until at some point the number of loaded classes grows too big and OutOfMemoryError happens.

## Root cause ##

What's preventing the symlinked war from getting deleted is this line in org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig#deleteRedeployResources:

current = current.getCanonicalFile();

The canonical file is war file the symlink is pointing to, and the isDeletableResource method determines that it should not be deleted.

## Context ##

This issue has been plaguing me on a CentOS/6 server running 7.0.55, but appears to affect 8.x and 9.x as well. I reproduced it locally on OSX.

=> The silent(Host, contextPath) call shall respect the defaults and do not silence this logger if other loggers are not silenced.

2. The Engine name used in Tomcat.getLoggerName() is wrong.

Tomcat.getEngine() uses ""Tomcat"" as the name, not ""default"".

=> It shall get the actual Engine instance from Host.getParent().

3. Tomcat.getLoggerName() shall use the same logic as ContainerBase.logName()

=> It does not handle """" and null names correctly."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58905
Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.68 (violetagg)|fix|58946|Ensure that the request parameter map remains immutable when processing via a RequestDispatcher. (markt)|ApplicationHttpRequest should enforce immutability of ParameterMap|"JavaDoc for ServletRequest.getParameterMap(), both ours and the one at Oracle site [1] says:

""Returns: an immutable java.util.Map containing [...]""

The problem is that this immutability is not enforced by org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationHttpRequest class that is used to implement included or forwarded requests.

Note that org.apache.catalina.util.ParameterMap class used for usual (not forwarded) requests does enforce immutability. An example of message from that class is shown below.


Reproducible with current Tomcat 8.0-dev.

Steps to reproduce
--------------------
1. Put the following two JSPs into ROOT web application:

test.jsp
[[[
<%@page contentType=""text/plain;charset=UTF-8"" import=""java.util.*""%>
<%
RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher(""test2.jsp"");
rd.forward(request, response);
%>
]]]

test2.jsp
[[[
<%@page contentType=""text/plain;charset=UTF-8"" import=""java.util.*""%>
<%
Map map = request.getParameterMap();
map.put(""foo"", ""bar"");
%>
<%= map %>
]]]

2. Call
http://localhost:8080/test.jsp?z=a

Actual:
--------
The following response is observed:
[[[
{foo=bar, z=[Ljava.lang.String;@3877a5}
]]]

Expected:
---------
If I call the test2.jsp application directly, the behaviour is as expected:

http://localhost:8080/test2.jsp?z=a

HTTP Status 500 - An exception occurred processing JSP page /test2.jsp at line 4

root cause

java.lang.IllegalStateException: No modifications are allowed to a locked ParameterMap

Hi,
please file a bug in Tomcat, this is clearly an issue with NIO/Tomcat implementation. It may happens less frequently with 2.2.5-SNAPSHOT, but still the issue is with Tomcat.

Thanks

Or in other words, we want some means of updating the running application in a controlled fashion for production use.

Purpose:
Today Tomcat always writes an absolute response for redirects per RFC2616 standards.  However as many modern browsers support 302s to relative Locations as explained in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_location , our friendly Tomcat application server should allow configuration to write back 302s in the more friendly form.

The ripple effect of this where applications choose to use this setting, will be very good for cpu cycles of web servers and load balancers all over the world.   This can greatly reduce the need for ProxyPassReverse in the Apache web server, and also for URL rewriting happenin in physical load balancers.

Tomcat 8.0.29 changes the behaviour of requests for paths without a trailing slash. It seems to be limited to context roots, e.g. /examples instead of /examples/servlets.

When calling /examples on 8.0.28 it responds with a 302 redirecting to /examples/, but 8.0.29 responds with a 200.

I would say that people should be more careful with their URL:s, but this change in default behaviour is probably going to cause problems. It is probably not correct to respond with /examples/index.html, when accessing /examples. This changes any relative paths on a website, since there will be a / missing. This may indeed be verified by clicking any of the links in the 8.0.29 /examples response HTML. Clicking them causes the browser to fetch e.g. /servlets instead of /examples/servlets.

Accessing /examples/servlets however causes a 302 to /examples/servlets/, just like 8.0.28.


To reproduce:

1. Download Tomcat 8.0.28 and 8.0.29

stacktrace of error

When calling `HttpServletResponse#sendRedirect()`, if `RemoteIpFilter` is in use, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown (see attached stack-trace). 

The error steams from the way `RemoteIpFilter.XForwardedResponse` tries to rewrite the 'Location' header. According to the servlet API, a response is considered committed after calling `sendRequest()` and it is illegal to call either `reset()` or another `sendRequest()` thereafter.

WORKAROUND:

Comment the code after `super.sendRedirect(location);`. However, this effectively disables the `RemoteIpFilter` on the response path and makes the server return an URL with incorrect scheme.

Solution
---------
The workaround is to remove the following two files from lib directory:
tomcat7-websocket.jar
websocket-api.jar

I guess that removing tomcat7-websocket.jar alone is enough, but I only tested with removing both of them.

It is known that websocket API (JSR356) requires Java 7, so there is no use for those jar files when running with Java 6.

Good news:
1. The examples web app runs successfully without those files. (I feared that it won't start).
2. JSR356 examples successfully show their HTML pages. Attempting to open a websocket connection fails immediately, as expected.

Thoughts
---------
1. Starting Tomcat 7.0.65 with Java 6 logs a nice warning:

26.11.2015 19:12:19 org.apache.tomcat.websocket.server.WsSci onStartup
INFO: JSR 356 WebSocket (Java WebSocket 1.1) support is not available
when running on Java 6. To suppress this message, run Tomcat on Java 7,
remove the WebSocket JARs from $CATALINA_HOME/lib or add the WebSocket JARs
to the tomcat.util.scan.DefaultJarScanner.jarsToSkip property in
$CATALINA_BASE/conf/catalina.properties. Note that the deprecated Tomcat 7
WebSocket API will be available. 

The above warning message is no longer written by 7.0.66. Tomcat 7.0.66 just fails.

2. An update to installation instructions (RUNNING.txt) is needed.

Currently it says to unpack the binary archive, but with Java 6 that is no longer enough.

3. An update to Windows installer is needed.

If I remember correctly, there is no option to omit those jar files when installing Tomcat."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58658

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.66 (violetagg)|fix|34319|Only load those keys in StoreBase.processExpire from JDBCStore, that are old enough, to be expired. Based on a patch by Tom Anderson. (fschumacher)|StoreBase.processExpires() is very inefficient|"Using a session store such as JDBCStore with the default configuration 
(Engine.backgroundProcessorDelay=10 and StandardManager.processExpiresFrequency=6), 
StoreBase.processExpires() will wake up once a minute and load all stored sessions into memory.   So, 
with the default 30-minute session-timeout setting, this means we are loading up to 29 minutes worth 
of sessions that won't be ready to expire.   In this example we load 30x more sessions than we actually 
need to. 

Since the purpose of StoreBase.processExpires() is to find sessions that are ready to be expired, it 
doesn't make sense to load ALL session for cases where we could pre-filter sessions BEFORE loading 
them.   For example, JDBCStore could use a where clause to reduce the number of sessions loaded as 
candidates to be expired and FileStore could query the filesystem for the age of the files before loading.    
The current behavior could be the worst-case fallback for Stores in which it is not possible to get age 
information.

I propose that StoreBase.processExpires() be refactored to load only keys of old sessions when possible 
by providing an oldKeys() method that may be overriden.   By default this would just return all keys but 
it should be easy to extend this in specialized versions (I will provide a sample patch to illustrate for 
JDBCStore)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34319

Currently, this breaks down if a key store or trust store is required for SSL configuration as Tomcat requires them to be readable directly from the filesystem rather than from within a jar file.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.66 (violetagg)|add|58486|Protect against two further possible memory leaks associated with XML parsing. (markt)|JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener: initialize two further JRE classes|"I would like to propose adding a further couple of classes to those that Tomcat's JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener statically initializes.

The classes com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.DOMNormalizer and com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.serialize.DOMSerializerImpl, both within rt.jar, each contain a static final field of type RuntimeException named 'abort'.  When these classes are statically initialized, these exceptions are created and their stacktraces filled in.  If a web app class happens to be in the call stack when either class's exception is created, this class cannot then be garbage collected when the web app is stopped because an exception in a static field of a class has a reference to it.  This then causes a PermGen leak as the web apps's classloader, and all of the classes it loaded, cannot be garbage-collected.

To reproduce this issue, use the following servlet class:

package com.example;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import org.w3c.dom.Document;
import org.w3c.dom.ls.DOMImplementationLS;

public class DOMNormalizerLeakServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException {
        try {
            Document document = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().newDocument();
            document.createElement(""test"");
            DOMImplementationLS implementation = (DOMImplementationLS)document.getImplementation();
            implementation.createLSSerializer().writeToString(document);
            response.getWriter().write(""done"");
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            throw new ServletException(e);
        }
    }
}

and the following web.xml file:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<web-app xmlns=""http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee""
	 xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
	 xsi:schemaLocation=""http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_1.xsd""

        <servlet-name>test</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/index.html</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>   
</web-app>

I've reproduced this problem with the latest Tomcat (8.0.27) and the latest Oracle JDK8 (1.8.0_60), by:

* deploying a web app consisting of the above servlet class and deployment descriptor to Tomcat,
* viewing the index.html page generated by Tomcat (the browser should show the word 'done'),
* reloading the web app using the Tomcat manager app,
* clicking the 'Find leaks' button in the Diagnostics section of the manager app, which reveals a possible memory leak,
* using a profiler such as JVisualVM to confirm that Tomcat now has a 'destroyed' classloader that could not be garbage collected because there is a chain of references from a JRE class to the servlet class it loaded.

Here's a path from the classloader to the exception, which I obtained with the help of JVisualVM:

this     - value: org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader #3
 <- <classLoader>     - class: com.example.DOMNormalizerLeakServlet, value: org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader #3
  <- [2]     - class: java.lang.Object[], value: com.example.DOMNormalizerLeakServlet class DOMNormalizerLeakServlet
   <- [2]     - class: java.lang.Object[], value: java.lang.Object[] #4319
    <- backtrace     - class: java.lang.RuntimeException, value: java.lang.Object[] #4318
     <- abort (sticky class)     - class: com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.serialize.DOMSerializerImpl, value: java.lang.RuntimeException #1

There is a straightforward workaround for this: add the names of these two classes to the classesToInitialize attribute for the JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener.  This then causes the classes to be statically initialized by Tomcat itself and keeps web app classes out of the stacktrace of these exceptions.

I have filed a bug report with Oracle to change the behaviour of these two classes.  However, until this gets fixed (if it gets fixed at all), it would be appreciated if the JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener could be adapted to handle these two classes."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58486

Same can be said for :   ""abstract void  actionInternal(ActionCode actionCode, Object param)"" method as well.

We have a requirement of having a custom implementation for AbstractHttp11Processor but now we cannot because these methods cannot be overridden unless we modify in the tomcat source code. Thus this is proving a blocker for us.

The exception is not user-friendly, and somehow misleading. From the stack trace, user is likely to consider it as a tomcat bug. 

The solution might be adding url-pattern /error.html to the default servlet, or just change the url-pattern to match all the html resources.

My suggestion is to avoid such NPE and tell user what to do.

Details for how to reproduce the bug

When putting an HTTP server behind a forwarder -- such as nginx or Amazon CloudFront -- special HTTP headers are sent -- such as X-Forwarded-Proto and X-Forwarded-For -- to allow the server to reconstruct the URL that the client used for making the request. This is important, for example, to construct a meaningful ""Location"" HTTP response header.

The purpose of the RemoteIpFilter is to give servlets the impression that they are operating on the original, pre-forwarded request. Hence, without changing any line of code, the existing servlets can construct meaningful URL for the client.

Unfortunately, the wrapped request that RemoteIpFilter produces does not correctly implement getRequestURL(). In fact, it simply forwards this call to the wrapped request, which contains non-meaningful information about e.g., the HTTP schema [1][2]. This currently breaks Jetty, which relies on getRequestURL to construct a correct ""Location"" header [3]. (See attachment for details on how to reproduce the bug.)

I'm not sure what the best technical solution would be. Should RemoteIpFilter.XForwardedRequest implement its own getRequestURL? I haven't found an implementation for it. Could somebody point me to it?

eg. We have an embedded server created and started something like:

 org.apache.catalina.startup.Embedded embedded = new Embedded();
 org.apache.catalina.Engine engine engine = embedded.createEngine();
 engine.setName("""");
 embedded.setContainer(engine);
 embedded.addEngine(engine);

 ...

 String startPathContextRoot = ""c:\website\data\startPath"";
 org.apache.catalina.Context startPathContext = embedded.createContext(""/startPath"",startPathContextRoot);

 embedded.start()

Then a request to http://host:port//startPath returns 404.
Whereas at Tomcat 7.0.52 it returns what we would expect from a request to 
http://host:port/startPath.
The same behaviour is seen with requests to extended URLs eg:
  http://host:port//startPath/anotherPath.
where they end up at the servlet as expected with 7.0.53 and not with 7.0.54

Debugging this a bit I found that the problem was introduced at 7.0.53 and by the changes under 
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56501
which for Tomcat 7 were revision 
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1594028
If I run our app without these changes in at 7.0.54 then it works fine.

Looking at the changes in the revision I saw some tests were added and so I tried adding some new tests to tomcat/trunk/test/org/apache/catalina/connector/TestRequest.java which I think example the problem:

    @Test
    public void testBug56501p() throws Exception {
        doBug56501(""/path"", ""//path"", ""/path"");
    }

    @Test
    public void testBug56501q() throws Exception {
        doBug56501(""/path"", ""//path/"", ""/path"");
    }

    @Test
    public void testBug56501r() throws Exception {
        doBug56501(""/path"", ""//path/bob"", ""/path"");
    }

    @Test
    public void testBug56501s() throws Exception {
        doBug56501(""/path"", ""//path/bob/"", ""/path"");

If I run these at 7.0.53 they pass.
and running at 7.0.54 they fail with:

The setting name is quoteAttributeEL and it is configured as initialisation parameter of JSP Servlet (per web application configuration is possible) and as a command line option for JspC. The default value was changed to true, which restores behaviour implemented in Tomcat 7.0.64. It means that attribute quoting is applied on top of EL quoting. This provides better compatibility with older versions of Tomcat and other implementations. (kkolinko)|EL Parser escaping dollar sign not ${ or ${...}|"In the EL 3.0 spec it says...

    The resulting values would again be the strings ${exprA} and #{exprB}.

I believe that means it should not escape lets say ""Price: \\$500.00"" it should instead output ""Price: \$500.00""(it currently would output ""Price: $500.00"") but should instead escape ""Price: \\${500.00}"" and the output of that would be ""Price: ${500.00}"".

Normally this wouldn't be run into, but I happened to run into this issue passing javascript code through the EL processor, that happens to have some escaped dollar signs inside some regex strings.

We found this during load tests, it only happened to one message out of millions but there is nothing special about that message.

We have a class that wraps javax.websocket.RemoteEndpoint.Basic to ensure that it's thread-safe - so messages are never sent from multiple threads on one socket.

The FutureToSendHandler gets stuck waiting for the call to onResult. Looking at the code, logically sendStringByCompletion(msg, completion) (WsRemoteEndpoint.java:573) must not call the onResult for some code path. I am trying to figure out where but no luck so far.

This is the first time we have seen this problem over many load tests so unfortunately we can't try to replicate on the latest at the moment.

JUnit test to show the exception

Overview: 

QueryStatsComparator may throw java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Comparison method violates its general contract! 
This happens in specific situations depending on the data in the reported queries. In our environment this occurs every time we keep the server running until the maxCapacity (1000 items) is reached and the removeOldest method is called. I have managed to narrow down the test data from more than 1000 records to around 40 items and created a JUnit test to showcase the error. I needed to copy some parts out of the SlowQueryReport class and made some simplifications as the QueryStatsComparator is not reachable from outside.

Steps to Reproduce: 

Please use the attached JUnit source code to reproduce this error.

Additional Builds and Platforms: 

This bug seems to happen on all platforms.
We are using Tomcat 8, tomcat-dbcp 8.0.24, JDK 1.80.0_60.

Additional Information: 

It seems to be a problem of the first two lines of the QueryStatsComparator. Note that a single change in the data of the unit test may cause the Exception not to occur.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.65 (violetagg)|fix|58284|Correctly implement session serialization so non-serializable attributes are skipped with a warning. Patch provided by Andrew Shore. (markt)|StandardSession attempts to silently write NonSerializable objects|"Customer reported an issue with non-serializable objects when using our DynamoDB Session manager (https://github.com/aws/aws-dynamodb-session-tomcat/issues/30). After digging into the code it looks like StandardSession is attempting to do several things when giving non-serializable attributes. For top level objects that don't implement serializable it silently removes it. That code is working fine although I am a little wary that it doesn't fail as this could hide bugs in the users code and make it difficult for them to determine why a certain attribute isn't being persisted to the backing store. After that StandardSession attempts to write the remaining attributes to the ObjectOutputStream. If a serialization exception is encountered here (i.e. some object in the object graph does not implement Serializable) then the exception is caught and a special indicator NOT_SERIALIZED is written to the object stream and a warning is logged. Now internally ObjectOutputStream is handling the same exception and writing it's own special marker, TC_EXCEPTION, and the serialized exception object to the stream. This is written before StandardSession has a chance to write NOT_SERIALIZED. In StandardSession.readObject there is logic to skip deserializing any objects that have been written to the stream as NOT_SERIALIZED. This code can never actually be executed though as ObjectInputStream is checking if there are any occurences of TC_EXCEPTION and will deserialize the exception object, wrap it in a WriteAbortedException and throw it out. This causes a session with non-serializable objects in the attributes to be written ""successfully"" but causes an exception to be thrown when attempting to read that same session.

I understand modifying StandardSession to now throw exceptions when non-serializable objects are encountered could be considered a breaking change so I propose adding some kind of overload or configuration to enable this behavior for users that want to opt in. Failing fast when non-serializable attributes are detected seems like the right way to go as this should be fixed in the customers code. I'm willing to submit a patch for this although I wanted to open the issue first to make sure you concur with my assessment and coding up a patch is worth my time."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58284

Parsing of the delimiting ${ and } is the responsibility of the JSP specification. (markt)|EL Parser escaping dollar sign not ${ or ${...}|"In the EL 3.0 spec it says...
    Alternatively, the escape characters \$ and \# can be used to escape what would
otherwise be treated as an eval-expression. Given the literal-expressions:
        \${exprA}
        \#{exprB}
    The resulting values would again be the strings ${exprA} and #{exprB}.

I believe that means it should not escape lets say ""Price: \\$500.00"" it should instead output ""Price: \$500.00""(it currently would output ""Price: $500.00"") but should instead escape ""Price: \\${500.00}"" and the output of that would be ""Price: ${500.00}"".

Normally this wouldn't be run into, but I happened to run into this issue passing javascript code through the EL processor, that happens to have some escaped dollar signs inside some regex strings.

It maybe a little more acceptable to use \${ and \#{ as the escapes, as that is a better indication that there is about to be an expression"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57136
Jasper|Tomcat 7.0.65 (violetagg)|fix|58296|Fix a memory leak in the JSP unloading feature that meant that using a value other than -1 for maxLoadedJsps triggered a memory leak once the limit was reached. (markt)|Possible memory leak in JspRuntimeContext|"Limitation of maxLoadedJsps and usage of tag files may result in a memory leak in JspRuntimeContext.

Steps to reproduce the leak:

1) Set Tomcat in its web.xml to production mode and limit the max jsp count to 2
	
	<init-param>
    	<param-name>maxLoadedJsps</param-name>
		<param-value>2</param-value>
	</init-param>
	<init-param>
		<param-name>development</param-name>
		<param-value>false</param-value>
	</init-param>

2) deploy the attach WAR-file ""tomcat-test.war"". The WAR contains one HttpServlet, three jsps and one tag file. GET-Requests to http://localhost:8080/tomcat-test/test render the jsps in the sequence ""1.jsp"" -> ""2.jsp"" -> ""3.jsp"". 
JSPs 1.jsp and 3.jsp use the tag ""test.tag"", 2.jsp contains only html.

3) make at least 5 GET-Requests to http://localhost:8080/tomcat-test/test

4) take a heap dump

5) open the dump with Eclipse MAT

6) execute the OOQL-Query 
select * from org.apache.jasper.util.FastRemovalDequeue$Entry e where e.valid=false

7) ""Path To GC Roots"" (right click on one result) shows that the invalid entries are in the retained heap of the tag's JspServletWrapper and hence in the retained heap of JspRuntimeContext.

The retained heap of JspRuntimeContext grows with every unloaded Jsp (its Entry in the jspQueue).

The bug is reproducible with Tomcat 7.0.52 and 8.0.26.


Supposed causes:

1) FastRemovalDequeue: removed Entry-instances are flagged as invalid. The ""previous""-field of removed elements isn't set to null. So removed elements still reference their ""previous"" element (which still may be in the jspQueue of JspRuntimeContext)

2) JspServletWrappers of currently loaded jsps and tag files are stored in the ConcurrentHashMap ""jsps"" in JspRuntimeContext. JspServletWrappers of Tag files hold (indirectly over JspCompilationContext -> JasperTagInfo -> ImplicitTagLibraryInfo -> ParserController) references to JspServletWrapper instances with already removed ""unloadHandles"" (FastRemovalDequeue$Entry instances with valid == false). 

2) leads in combination with 1) to a reproducible memory leak: the chain of ""previous"" linked entries contains all JspServletWrappers of unloaded and currently loaded jsps. In combination with maxLoadedJsps != -1, the chain can grow till an OutOfMemoryError occurs."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58296

(markt)|_jspInit() never called on JSP with custom super class|"I have a JSP that extends a custom super class:

<@page extends=""com.example.MySuperServlet"" %>

My super class is defined as follows:

public abstract class MySuperServlet extends javax.servlet.GenericServlet implements javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage {
  @Override public void service(....) {
    _jspService(req, res);
  }
  @Override public void jspInit() {}
  @Override public void jspDestroy() {}
}


The problem is that the generated JSP class contains a method _jspInit() which is never called.
It initializes an expression factory (_el_expressionfactory) and an instance manager (_jsp_instancemanager).
Now that both are not initialized, I get NullpointerExceptions when calling the JSP, i.e. in some generated methods there is code like
_jsp_instancemanager.newInstance(_jspx_th_my_005fcustomtag_005f0)

Usually when there is no custom super class, tomcat extends the generated JSP class from org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase which calls _jspInit() from its init(ServletContext) method.

For my custom super class it is no option to extend org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase instead of GenericServlet because it is tomcat specific.
It is also no option to call _jspInit() directly from my jspInit() method, because _jspInit() is not part of the servlet/JSP spec and thus it is not defined in any interface.

Note that there is no problem with tomcat 6 and 5.

(markt)|Facilitate weaving by allowing ClassFileTransformer to be added to WebppClassLoader|"Most application servers provide a mechanism whereby web applications can instrument class bytecode. This is normally in the form of two or three instrumentation methods on the ClassLoader implementation responsible for web application class loading. Spring Framework, for example, provides a way to automatically detect and use the various instrumentable ClassLoaders provided by different application servers. However, since Tomcat's o.a.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader is not instrumentable, Spring cannot use it directly. Instead, it provides a class that extends WebappClassLoader to implement the instrumentation. Users must place this special spring-instrument-tomcat.jar file in $TOMCAT_HOME/lib and put a loader declaration in META-INF/context.xml in order to get this to work--rather a pain in the rear.

Spring's changes in the extended WebappClassLoader are really very trivial and involve only 2 classes: a helper class called WeavingTransformer [1] and the extended TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader [2]. I intend to port these changes to Tomcat for Tomcat 7 and 8 and submit a patch.

However, before I get started I needed to get two answers from the community:

1) Is there any objection to such a simple addition to WebappClassLoader? I think it would be an easy-but-big improvement to Tomcat.

2) What steps do I need to take to get this Spring code officially ""donated"" to Tomcat so that all legal requirements are met? The code is licensed Apache 2.0, so that at least should make it easier.

Initial draft of patch, created against trunk.

When data exceeding the value of the ""maxPostSize"" configuration parameter is posted within a deployed application, the application sees an empty request parameter map and cannot access the posted data, yet Tomcat returns a 200 status, indicating to the client that everything was processed successfully (which likely will mislead the client).  The correct behavior is to return a status of 413 (""Request Entity Too Large"") to indicate that the request could not be fully processed due to the size being too large.

Attached is a patch that will set the response status to 413 when Tomcat discovers that the posted data exceeds maxPostSize."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58031

and Tomcat 8 shows

Test: file:/C:/Install/apache-tomcat-8.0.23/webapps/test/WEB-INF/classe/test/pkg/Test.class


Tomcat 7 shows the similar result.

In a standalone Java program, the similar code shows the top-level classpath entry like xxx/classes where test/pkg/Test.class is saved.

I also tried Jetty, it shows it correctly like:

Test: file:/C:/Install/jetty-distribution-9.3.0.v20150612/test-base/webapps/test/WEB-INF/classes/


So what I expect is WEB-INF/classes, is there any reason why Tomcat returns the full path of the class file instead of WEB-INF/classes ?

Servlet which starts asynchronous processing and intentionally waits for a timeout before dispatching to a static HTML file.

Overview:
When repeatedly polling an asynchronous servlet which (intentionally) times out, I occasionally see the following exception in the console:

Jul 20, 2015 8:58:45 AM org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter checkRecycled
INFO: Encountered a non-recycled request and recycled it forcedly.
org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter$RecycleRequiredException

	at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.NioEndpoint$Poller.run(NioEndpoint.java:1234)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)

This coincides with a request not receiving any response.

The majority of times the servlet is called, the correct response is returned as expected once the request times out, however on occasion (sometimes within 1 min, sometimes not until 30 mins of successful requests have passed) I see this exception and AsyncListener.onTimeout() is never called to produce the response.

Steps to reproduce:
0) Configure Tomcat to use the NIO connector
1) Deploy the attached TimeoutServlet (note: add a static HTML page 'timeout.html' to the root of the web application to serve as the timeout response).
2) Using a tool of your choice (I used JMeter), repeatedly send a request to the servlet and wait for the timeout response before sending the next request.

Actual Results:
Eventually, one of the requests will receive no response and the above exception will be written to the console.

Expected Results:
Every request should receive the timeout response (timeout.html) after 1 second and no exception should appear in the console.

Jasper|Tomcat 7.0.64 (violetagg)|fix|58178|Expressions in a tag file should use the tag file's PageContext rather than that of the containing page. (markt)|Exception not passed to c:catch in custom jsp tag|"Created attachment 32935 [details]
Project demonstrating the problem

If a custom tag uses the jstl <catch> tag, then the exception is saved into the page attributes, but is not actually available to other tags via EL expressions.

If, however, the <catch> tag is used directly in a jsp page, then the exception is propagated into the var and visible to subsequent El expressions.


I'm attaching a small project that contains a taglib that demonstrates the problem. The project contains 2 jsps:

1. no-tagtest.jsp that uses the <catch> and other jstl tags directly in the jsp
2. tagtest.jsp that references a custom tag that uses the <catch> and other jstl tags.

The problem seems to be that when a custom tag uses any other tags, then the page context is an instance of JspContextWrapper. When resolving el expressions, the JspContextWrapper.getElContext() returns an ELContext for the rootContext, rather than the page context. In this example, the <catch> tag saves the exception as an attribute named ""error"" in the page context attributes (the page context will be an instance of JspContextWrapper). However, when the ""error"" variable is referenced later in an EL expression, the EL mechanism has a page context that is the root context of the JspContextWrapper and thus can't resolve that variable."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58178

I'm currently trying to register my own WebsocketEndpoint programatically, i.e. not using the annotations. JSR-356 says this is possible by using the ServerContainer which can be obtained from the ServletContext (see section 6.4). 
The ServerContainer provides two methods that can be used to add a new endpoint. I do not want to use the one that takes a Class<?>, but I need to use the one that takes a ServerEndpointConfig. This is because I want to add some UserProperties to the ServerEndpointConfig before it is added - and I cannot do that when using the method that takes the Class<?>.

When I'm doing this and try it, I get the following exception:

When looking at the source of Tomcat, it seems that the method taking the Class<?> adds a userProperty to the ServerEndpointConfig, which contains an instance of PojoMethodMapping. This is not done when directly calling the method that takes the ServerEndpointConfig - and exactly that PojoMethodMapping seems to be missing in my case.

As PojoMethodMapping is not defined by the JSR, but is a Tomcat class, I  would like to not instantiate it myself, but I think the instantiation of PojoMethodMapping should be done in Tomcat in the method taking the ServerEndpointConfig, as the one with the Class<?> parameter calls that one anyway.

I patched tomcat locally and it seems to work for me after that adjustment. I therefore propose that this adjustment be integrated into trunk.
I will upload my changes to GitHub right away and add a comment with the link here.

To Reproduce Bug:

1) Set allowCasualMultipartParsing to ""true"" in context.xml,
2) Create a HTML form with enctype=""multipart/form-data"",
3) Submit the form it to a servlet that calls HttpServletRequest.getParts(),
4) If you leave any field empty in the form you will get a NPE.

Expected Results: 

Whether there is an empty field or not HttpServletRequest.getParts() should complete without any exceptions. Empty fields should return empty Part objects.

Actual Results:

Got NPE.

Additional Information: 

Whether allowCasualMultipartParsing is true or false if the servlet is annotated as @MultipartConfig, error disappears and HttpServletRequest.getParts() behaves as expected. But since sole purpose of allowCasualMultipartParsing is the opportunity of using getParts() in a ServletFilter, this is not a solution.

Despite the comment the order is wrong, you have to acquire a read lock then release write lock to make sure the race condition does not occur.

The correct way to do it is:

                } finally {
                    writerLock.readLock().lock();

I have an implementation of LifecycleListener that is configured in META-INF/context.xml of a web application and performs some configuration work on CONFIGURE_START_EVENT.

Roughly:
[[[

import org.apache.catalina.Lifecycle;

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
]]]

The work of the listener can fail due to some external condition.

Steps to reproduce:
All the following is performed via HTML UI of the Manager web application.
1. Undeploy application foo.
2. Upload foo.war.
3. The external condition is not configured.
The following is observed:
- The application fails to start.
- A org.apache.catalina.LifecycleException happens and is logged into catalina.dddd-yy-mm.log
- The Manager app shows the application as deployed and is in ""stopped"" state.

This all is as expected.

4. Fix the external condition and start the web application via Manager.
Observed behaviour:
- The application is started. The manager webapp shows that it is started and running.

Expected behaviour:
- Being able to access /foo

Actual behaviour:
- Error 404. The access log shows that the request was served by the ROOT web application.
- No errors or warnings are logged

If I stop/start the foo application, it stops and starts successfully, but nothing changes.
If I stop/start the ROOT application, it stops and starts successfully, but nothing changes.

If I undeploy and re-deploy the foo application, the situation resolves and the application can be accessed successfully.


Thoughts:
----------
1. Maybe the error is in Mapper. Maybe the error is handling of FailedContext. 

The initial error may be a deployment error (resulting in use of FailedContext), but in this case it is odd that starting the application (after fixing the external condition) is performed successfully and it is shown as running.

If the error is in the Mapper, why the error is fixed when the application is undeployed?

2. We already have test cases for failed startups,
org.apache.catalina.core.TestStandardContext
-> testBug46243()
-> testWebappLoaderStartFail()
-> testWebappListenerConfigureFail()

The testWebappListenerConfigureFail() test was designed to reflect this situation. I guess there is a difference in deployment scenario via Manager webapp vs. the one used in the test.

3. I wonder, if the Manager webapp had a ""[Redeploy]"" button for a webapp, like it has a ""[Reload]"" one, would pressing it be able to resolve this issue. I will file an enhancement request for that."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57700

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.63 (violetagg)|fix|57931|Ensure that TLS connections with the NIO HTTP connector that experience issues during the handshake (e.g. missing or invalid client certificate) are closed cleanly and that the client receives the correct error code rather than simply closing the connection. (markt)|NIO connector incorrectly closes connection when client certificate verification fails|"Created attachment 32738 [details]
Test program to reproduce the issue

If tomcat is set to use TLS and clientAuth=""want"" or clientAuth=""true"", it appears the NIO connector closes the connection in response to an untrusted client certificate.  This behavior differs from the BIO connector, and violates RFC 5246, which states that a fatal alert must be provided if ""some aspect of the cert chain was unacceptable"".  By closing the connection, this causes OpenSSL to provide an obscure error ""Unexpected EOF"", which indicates the TLS protocol was violated.

I have attached a Python test program which demonstrates this behavior.  Simply run this program against a tomcat server, configured with the given server.xml Connector shown below.  Removal of the protocol attribute will use the BIO connector, and inclusion of the protocol attribute will demonstrate the NIO connector.


Steps to reproduce:
1) Setup a tomcat server with the connector configuration shown below
2) Install Python as well as pyOpenSSL
3) (If necessary) Modify the test.py program to communicate with the appropriate server and port.
4) Run the test.py program.
(Alternatively, if Python is not available, you should be able to use 


Desired behavior:
Instead of closing the connection, the NIO connector should provide a fatal error response to an invalid certificate, like the BIO connector.  

I would strongly prefer if the response would match the response provided by Java through the BIO connector: ""alert certificate unknown"".  This would allow our program to use either connector without any changes.


Impact:
Due to this bug, when using the NIO connector, our program cannot differentiate between an unexpected network problem and a certificate issue during the handshake.  Because of this, the program is not able to flag and react to the possibility the certificate is invalid--it assumes an unexpected network error occurred.



RFC 5246, 7.4.6.  Client Certificate:
If the client does not send any certificates, the
server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake without
client authentication, or respond with a fatal handshake_failure
alert.  Also, if some aspect of the certificate chain was
unacceptable (e.g., it was not signed by a known, trusted CA), the
server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake
(considering the client unauthenticated) or send a fatal alert.

Note that a side-effect of this change is that files with modification times in the future are treated as if they are unmodified. (markt)|autodeploy sometimes fails to redeploy the latest war|"if a war file is updated multiple times within a 1s window the autodeployment logic may fail to deploy the latest war.

this is particularly a problem if doing something like wget to install a war directly to the webapps directory.  it may fail (because the zip is invalid) but then not retry when the download completes (presumably because the file timestamp is not different to the failed timestamp, even though the file *is* different.)

for example, try the following script:

    while [ true ]  ; do
      curl http://path/to/large/sample.war -o sample.war
      sleep 15
      if [ ! -d sample ] ; then exit ; fi
    done

with the sleep 15, tomcat should be guaranteed to unpack the war (running with its default 10s detect audodeployment files). however this script usually fails one in 20 times with a sufficiently large war file (where download time is >5s). in such cases the last autodeployment attempt logs an invalid zip, there is no subsequent autodeployment, and the timestamp of the completed (valid) download is identical to the log timestamp of the failed autodeployment, at least to a one-second resolution (common on filesystems).

what i suspect is happening is, for example:

    00:00:00.100 sample.war is partially written
    00:00:00.200 autodeployment is attempted, and fails
    00:00:00.300 sample.war is completely written
    00:00:10.200 subsequent autodeployment cycle does not attempt re-deployment

i suspect that at time 00:00:00.200, when the deployment fails, it records a ""last update"" timestamp.  10 seconds later it checks the timestamp of the file on disk, which will be 00:00:00 (note no milliseconds) which is not later than the ""last update"" timestamp and so it incorrectly skips the redeployment.

this could probably also result in the following situation

    00:00:00.100 sample.war v1 is written
    00:00:00.200 autodeployment is done
    00:00:00.300 sample.war v2 is written
    00:00:10.200 subsequent autodeployment cycle does not attempt re-deployment

and so v1 is deployed even though v2 was subsequently written.

i suggest that autodeployment should wait for files to stabilise, i.e. skipping any file updated within the 1s window immediately prior to autodeployment (and ensuring that it is picked up on the next autodeployment cycle, unless it is still being changed).

there are workarounds:

* download to a tmp directory then atomically `mv` the file to the webapps directory upon completion
* use the manager webapp instead of autodeployment

but it would be nice to fix this so that autodeployment works as advertised (and i think the fix sketched here should be fairly straightforward)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57765

(markt)|WebappClassLoader throws a ClassNotFoundError when the Manager is deploying a new WAR|"Overview:
When contexts are updated through the Tomcat manager interface, ServletContextListener.contextDestroyed implementations which need to load classes throw ClassNotFoundError.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an instance of Tomcat 8.0.20
2. In server.xml, configure the Host with unpackWARs=""true"" autoDeploy=""false"".
3. Check out the example webapp from https://github.com/austinjones/ClassNotFoundGenerator
4. Build the testing WAR using the 'distribute' ant task.
5. Deploy the WAR using an HTTP request to this URL:
http://<your-local-tomcat>/manager/text/deploy?
 war=path/to/workspace/ClassNotFoundGenerator/dist/ClassNotFoundGenerator.war
 &config=path/to/workspace/ClassNotFoundGenerator/web/context.xml
 &path=/ClassNotFoundGenerator
 &update=true
6. Open localhost.log, and verify the ClassNotFoundError was logged.

Actual results:
The ClassNotFoundError is thrown by TestcaseContextListener.contextDestroyed, and printed to localhost.log.  Any further work the context listener was responsible for is not executed.

Expected Results:
The WebappClassLoader successfully loads classes during ServletContextListener.contextDestroyed, and completes without a throw.  No ClassNotFoundError is printed to localhost.log

Build Date & Hardware:
Tomcat 8.0.12 on CentOS Linux 6.6

Additional Builds and Platforms:
Tomcat 8.0.12 on Windows 7 SP1
Tomcat 8.0.20 on Windows 7 SP1
Tomcat 8.0.20 on CentOS Linux 6.6

Note: if you try the 'steps to reproduce' on 8.0.12, the deployment will probably fail due to bug 56398 - which I worked around in 8.0.12.  You'll be able to deploy if you change the name of the test app to 'classnotfoundgenerator'.

Additional Information:
ServletContextListeners that need to load classes during the contextDestroyed call throw ClassNotFoundError, when the application is deployed as a WAR through the Manager interface.  Here is an example listener, where ThisClassNotFound is not loaded for the first time in contextDestroyed.

The ClassLoader gives up on loading the class.  The WebResourceSet it would have used to load the class from (in the method StandardRoot.getResourceInternal) is a DirResourceSet pointed to the exploded directory path - e.g. /path/to/tomcat/webapps/ClassNotFoundGenerator/.  The path it generates in DirResourceSet.getResource is /path/to/tomcat/webapps/ClassNotFoundGenerator/WEB-INF/classes/com/avadyne/ThisClassNotFound.class - the path is correct.  The file doesn't exist, and it returns a new EmptyResource(root, path, f).

When the WebappClassLoader attempts to load the class, the .class file (and the entire exploded directory) is not on the disk.  The bug occurs during these frames of the ClassNotFoundError stack trace (8.0.20).

 java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/avadyne/ThisClassNotFound

HostConfig.checkResources:1231 deletes the exploded directory
HostConfig.checkResources:1236 calls into StandardContext.reload
StandardContext.reload:3739 eventually invokes the ServletContextListeners

Once the contextDestroyed listeners are executed, the .class file doesn't exist (HostConfig.checkResources deleted it).  

It is unsafe for HostConfig.checkResources to delete the unpacked directory before the context is stopped.  However, WebappClassLoader is correct to throw a ClassNotFoundError, since the class doesn't exist on disk."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57772

It seems that when an error occurres (e.g. 403 reported by HttpServletResponse.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN)), which does not have error page handler declared in web.xml, the org.apache.catalina.Context.fireRequestDestroyEvent does not get called.

The problem may be related to the following change:

https://github.com/markt-asf/tomcat/commit/5e195b2f06dba1be3f90b0a9d1f67604af905e47

which was a fix of BUG#57252.

The problem may be in StandardHostValve

            // Look for a default error page
            errorPage = context.findErrorPage(0);

i.e. if error page is not found the reposnse is not marked as ""setErrorReported""

i.e. if request is synchronous and the error report is not required (caused by missing error page) the important lifecycle method is not called.

The workaround is to declare universal error handler page

	<error-page>
		<location>...</location>
	</error-page>

which ensures that some error page is always found.

The problem may also be related to BUG#57314 as it has the same symptoms reported in

http://weld.cdi-spec.org/documentation/ see What do WELD-xxx warnings mean?

ie WELD-000225, WELD-000335, WELD-000715 errors that report leaked resources caused by missing lifecycle method call.

If you enable the org.apache.catalina.filters.RemoteIpFilter to allow an upstream proxy to control whether the server is available over HTTP/HTTPS by setting an header such as ""X-Forwarded-Proto"", this state is not replicated within the Response.

Therefore, when the uri is generated, the scheme is not replaced with the value that is actually available within the Request so it will generate for HTTP scheme only.

(kkolinko)"|Option to preserve original cookie header when unquoting cookie value|"This issue was originally fixed by introducing a new configuration option in Tomcat 8 in r1448679 (for 8.0.0), backported to Tomcat 7 in r1675821 (for 7.0.62). It has not been fixed in Tomcat 6 yet.

I am filing this into Bugzilla to better document the problem.

The problem is that method ""unescapeDoubleQuotes"" modifies bytes in the buffer that it is processing
(The method is LegacyCookieProcessor.unescapeDoubleQuotes() in current Tomcat 8, ServerCookie.unescapeDoubleQuotes() in current Tomcat 7 and 6).

As such, the value of original ""cookie"" HTTP header is corrupted. It can be noted by calling request.getHeader(""cookie"") or by logging the header value in AccessLogValve.

Steps to reproduce with current Tomcat 6 (6.0.43), Firefox 37.0.2:

1. Configure an AccessLogValve to log incoming ""cookie"" and outgoing ""set-cookie"" HTTP headers.

That is, uncomment AccessLogValve in Host element of server.xml and set the following value for pattern attribute:

    pattern=""%h %l %u %t &quot;%r&quot; %s %b [Cookie received: %{cookie}i] [Set-Cookie sent: %{set-cookie}o]""

2. Start Tomcat and open Servlets Examples -> Cookies  page in examples web application,

http://localhost:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/CookieExample

3. Fill the form to create a cookie and submit it:
Name: foo
Value: bar ""baz""

4. Re-visit the Cookies example page, so that browser sends you the cookie that was created.

5. Look into access log file.

The logs look like the following:

127.0.0.1 - - [07/May/2015:15:25:37 +0400] ""GET /examples/servlets/servlet/CookieExample HTTP/1.1"" 200 637 [Cookie received: -] [Set-Cookie sent: -]
127.0.0.1 - - [07/May/2015:15:28:24 +0400] ""POST /examples/servlets/servlet/CookieExample HTTP/1.1"" 200 809 [Cookie received: -] [Set-Cookie sent: foo=""bar \""baz\""""; Version=1]
127.0.0.1 - - [07/May/2015:15:28:42 +0400] ""GET /examples/servlets/servlet/CookieExample HTTP/1.1"" 200 714 [Cookie received: foo=""bar ""baz""\""""] [Set-Cookie sent: -]

Actual value:
[Cookie received: foo=""bar ""baz""\""""]
Expected value:
[Cookie received: foo=""bar \""baz\""""]

Notes:
======
1. This happens only with unquoting of '""' character. No other character are unquoted by unescapeDoubleQuotes() method.

2. Current specification of cookies (RFC6265) defines that cookie values cannot contain double quote and backslash characters. A well-behaving web application should not create cookies whose values contain such characters.

 cookie-value      = *cookie-octet / ( DQUOTE *cookie-octet DQUOTE )
 cookie-octet      = %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E
                       ; US-ASCII characters excluding CTLs,
                       ; whitespace DQUOTE, comma, semicolon,
                       ; and backslash

3. The fix introduced new system property,
org.apache.tomcat.util.http.ServerCookie.PRESERVE_COOKIE_HEADER

It defaults to 'false'. By default you have to opt-in for this fix by setting that property to 'true'.

When running in ""strict servlet compliance"" mode, that setting defaults to 'true' and the fix is enabled.

The new Rfc6265CookieProcessor implementation of CookieProcessor that is available as an opt-in feature in Tomcat 8 does not have this bug and is not affected by that configuration option."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57896

======================================================

Found out that the actual issue is not due to the mentioned exception message ""no cipher suites in common"" but instead the issue is due to the way X509KeyManager stores the private key. It uses map with keyAlias as key (converted to lowercase). And the calling code has to take care of passing keyAlias in lowercase while retrieving. This is correctly handled in JSSESocketFactory.getKeyManagers() method @line 594 if the key store type is default (JKS). 

But in case of NioEndpoint, the conversion of keyAlias to lowercase is missed and due to that, the private key is returned null causing the handshake to fail.

Please find attached the patch to fix the issue.

It would be good if we can throw exception with relevant message which would help us locate the issue faster.

Steps to reproduce:
------------------
1. Create a SSL enabled NIO connector with keyAlias name containing uppercase letters.
2. Try to connect to the NIO port over https. Then above exception can be seen if juli logging is enabled."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57833

}

The result is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. I would expect an IllegalArgumentException or a MethodNotFoundException.
The same I would expect if I invoke with null:

@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void testNull() {
    MethodExpression me = factory.createMethodExpression(context,
            ""${beanAA.echo2}"", null , new Class[]{String.class});
    me.invoke(context, null);
}

But this throws a NullPointerException instead.
I run into this because PrimeFaces handles AjaxListeners relatively bad and expect that there is a MethodNotFoundException or an IllegalArgumentException if they call a listener method with no pram.

try {
    listener.invoke(elContext, new Object[]{});
} 
catch (MethodNotFoundException mnfe) {
    processArgListener(context, elContext, event);
} 
catch (IllegalArgumentException iae) {

Wouldn't this lead you to believe if no alias is specified it will use the first key in the keystore?  This is not the case.

Steps to recreate:

Create a keystore using the recommended method: 

%JAVA_HOME%\bin\keytool"" -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA

(This will generate ${user.home}/.keystore if it does not exist.  If it does, specify the keystore value.)

Start tomcat with the default SSL connector defined, no ""keyAlias"" value specified, and the keystore we created previous specified as the keystoreFile.

It will use the cert in the file.

Add another cert (specify different name and values to differentiate between the two) to the keystore with :

%JAVA_HOME%\bin\keytool"" -genkey -alias tomcat2 -keyalg RSA

Shutdown and restart the tomcat instance.

patch against trunk.

The Cluster configuration document have shown that the channelSendOptions attribute of SimpleTcpCluster element can be configured in hexadecimal.
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/cluster.html

Digester set the value using IntrospectionUtils.setProperty method.
SimpleTcpCluster.setChannelSendOptions method takes an int argument.

Therefore, setProperty method will be attempted to convert hexadecimal using Constructor of Integer Class (See Integer(String s)).
As a result, hexadecimal value will cause a NumberFormatException.

So, the channelSendOptions is not able to be configured in hexadecimal.

On the other hand, when GroupChannel is used on Tomcat, the channelSendOptions will be set 10 or less (SYNC or ASYNC, ACK or Non-ACK), and it will be not set more than 10.
Therefore, the example for hexadecimal (""0x000B"") can be remove from the configuration document."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57864

My simple war application took orders of magnitude longer to load than in Tomcat 3.3, and root cause was new Tomcat 7 / Servlet 3.0 jar scanning to look for context config fragments.

This is a very painful process. I had to use FINE log level, parse thousands of Tomcat log messages, and google the various messages. This was a waste of time. All Tomcat 7 needed to do was log a message when the jar scan did not find anything in a jar, and recommend adding that jar to one of the filters in catalina.properties.

  tomcat.util.scan.DefaultJarScanner.jarsToSkip
  org.apache.catalina.startup.ContextConfig.jarsToSkip
  org.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig.jarsToSkip.


As an enhancement, please add a log message recommending adding a jar if scanning does not find anything. I would recommend setting the log level to FINE, and explicitly putting a logging.properties override for that message in logging.properties. Anyone new to Tomcat 7 can fix these messages by either following the recommendation, or commenting out the logging.properties override for the message.

This is low hanging fruit. It should be straight forward to add, and would be a huge help for anyone new to Tomcat 7 who are unaware of the performance impact of Servlet 3.0 jar scanning. It could even help Tomcat 7 veterans too, when they add/upgrade/replace existing jar files that unknowingly affect jar scanning performance.

(markt/kkolinko)|Improve logging in AprLifecycleListener and jni.Library when Tomcat-Native DLL fails to load|"I occasionally used a version of Tomcat-Native DLL that JVM failed to initialize. The error was logged to stderr, but to none of our log files.

Steps to reproduce with 8.0.14 on Windows with JDK 7u67:

1. Get a wrong version of tcnative-1.dll and put it into %CATALINA_HOME%/bin directory. I erroneously used a x64 DLL with a x86 JDK.

2. Start Tomcat and log output into a file:
cd bin
catalina.bat run >catalina.out 2>&1

3. Stop Tomcat
Ctrl+C or catalina.bat stop

4. Actual: An error (cited below) was logged onto console (catalina.out) but it is not present in catalina.2014-09-25.log file. The only relevant message in catalina.2014-09-25.log was ""The APR based Apache Tomcat Native library <...> was not found on the java.library.path: <...>.

Expected: A properly logged error.

Looking in the source code,
1) In AprLifecycleListener.init() the Throwable is caught but not logged.
2) The exception is printed by org.apache.tomcat.jni.Library.Library() constructor. The code looks like the following:

[[[
                String name = System.mapLibraryName(NAMES[i]);
                String path = System.getProperty(""java.library.path"");
                String sep = System.getProperty(""path.separator"");
                String [] paths = path.split(sep);
                for (int j=0; j<paths.length; j++) {
                    java.io.File fd = new java.io.File(paths[j] , name);
                    if (fd.exists()) {
                        t.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
                if ( i > 0)
                    err.append("", "");
                err.append(t.getMessage());
<...>
        if (!loaded) {
            err.append('(');
            err.append(System.getProperty(""java.library.path""));
            err.append(')');
            throw new UnsatisfiedLinkError(err.toString());
        }
]]]

The loop with ""fd.exists()"" does essentially the same thing that JRE itself is doing in loadLibrary() to locate the library file before actually trying to load it.

Thoughts on possible improvement:
===================================

A. Treat the case when ""fd.exists()"" as fatal and rethrow original exception.

This will change behaviour in case when both ""tcnative-1"" and ""libtcnative-1"" libraries are present in ""java.library.path"" directories and the first library fails to load while the second one succeeds.

With the current code it will print an error for the first library and may silently successfully load the second one. With the change that I am proposing it will fail with the first library without trying the second one.

I say that configuration with both libraries being present is unlikely,  and as it was printing an error for the first library I say that such configuration is a broken one.

Rethrowing original exception will provide better diagnostics (if AprLifecycleListener is modified to log it) and will remove printing to System.err.


B. Replace ""throw new UnsatisfiedLinkError(err.toString());"" with a custom Error class e.g. LibraryNotFoundError extends UnsatisfiedLinkError.

- Include original exceptions and library names into LibraryNotFoundError.

- Use this class in AprLifecycleListener to discern between UnsatisfiedLinkError from failed attempt to load a library versus the common ""library does not exist"" scenario.

In the former case, log it as a warning. In the latter case print original exceptions if debug logging is enabled. The usual informational message follows.


C. Simplify AprLifecycleListener class and call Library.initialize(null) directly without relying on reflection.

There are already references to the fields such as Library.APR_MAJOR_VERSION further in the code. There is no point in using reflection is this case.

In the unlikely case that tomcat-jni.jar is not on classpath, AprLifecycleListener should not be present in server.xml as well. In this case Connector.<init> will call AprLifecycleListener.isAprAvailable() but the call to init() will not be performed. It should succeed even if Library class is not on classpath.



For reference, the error message with 8.0.14 (with some path censoring) was:

According to w3.org ""Terminology"" link above,
1) Javadoc for SIMPLE_HTTP_REQUEST_CONTENT_TYPE_VALUES is a bit off (copy-pasted from another field). It is actually a collection of mime-type values for Content-Type header so that this header is treated as a ""simple header""

2) The check using SIMPLE_HTTP_REQUEST_CONTENT_TYPE_VALUES shall ignore any parameters that may be present in Content-Type header value.

E.g. ""Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8""  shall match successfully."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57534

Log files for the day the error occurred and context reloading stopped being automatic.  Context file for app in question included.

I have set up a context XML file within $TOMCAT_HOME\conf\Catalina\localhost which has a docbase on a network fileshare.  I have set up a WatchedResource for a handful of files on this fileshare so that whenever one of the files is updated, the context is refreshed.  This works fine for sometime, but after a while, I see an error in the logs saying ""java.io.IOException: The semaphore timeout period has expired"" (Log file with full stack trace is uploaded).

After we notice this error, I had to start the context back via the Tomcat manager (to be expected, since it appears that a short network unavailability caused the issue).  However, once the application is started manually, the WatchedResources being updated no longer force the context to reload.  We have to reload the context manually until we do a full restart of the Tomcat service."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56608

It is also a problem for other requests where the response headers may be affected by this lack of content causing different header values to be returned for GET vs. HEAD methods.

Some more info. Inside the ""org.apache.coyote.http11. AbstractHttp11Processor<S>.process"" method there is this cleanup code after the main request while() loop:

            // Finish the handling of the request
            rp.setStage(org.apache.coyote.Constants.STAGE_ENDINPUT);

            if (!isAsync() && !comet) {
                if (error) {
                    // If we know we are closing the connection, don't drain
                    // input. This way uploading a 100GB file doesn't tie up the
                    // thread if the servlet has rejected it.
                    getInputBuffer().setSwallowInput(false);
                }
                endRequest();
            }

Note the call to endRequest(). If I make my methods synchronous (i.e. remove WebAsyncMethod<>) then isAsync() returns false, this cleanup block is entered, endRequest() is called, ChunkedInputFilter.end() is called and the trailing metadata is consumed. All is good. Only when methods are async is this block skipped and the cleanup missed.

I'm sure it was coded this way for a good reason but perhaps there have been unintended consequences."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57621

The instance of SafeCommConnection is my ServerEndpoint POJO. When onClose is called in my ServerEndpoint I set a flag called isClosing to true. You can see on the right side that it is set to true so I have removed it from my app but the instance remains in memory held by the NioProtocol's connections HashMap. It seems that http11NioProtocol.release method is not getting called. Also, here is a stack trace in the stderr log file. It gets hundreds of these:

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.60 (violetagg)|fix|57570|Make the processing of trailer headers with chunked input optional and disabled by default. (markt)|Make processing of chunked encoding trailers an opt-in feature (align with HTTPD 2.4.12)|"Two weeks ago Apache HTTPD 2.4.12 release was announced. It contains a fix for the following issue:

<quote>
CVE-2013-5704 (cve.mitre.org)
 core: HTTP trailers could be used to replace HTTP headers
 late during request processing, potentially undoing or
 otherwise confusing modules that examined or modified
 request headers earlier.  Adds ""MergeTrailers"" directive to restore
 legacy behavior.
</quote>

-> [1],[2].


Apparently this has been discussed in the open for about a year in relation to HTTPD [3] and in general [4], but I have not seen anyone raising the issue for Tomcat yet.


In Tomcat  chunked encoding trailers are processed by ChunkedInputFilter  (.parseEndChunk() -> .parseHeader()). The values are available as headers (TestChunkedInputFilter$EchoHeaderServlet)

This was implemented via bug 49860 and is available since 6.0.30, 7.0.5 in all current versions. (r1039090 in 6.0.x)


If we follow in HTTPD steps, a solution is to make processing of these trailers an opt-in feature, being off by default.  A mitigation is already available with the existing features: it is possible to limit size of trailer headers via configuration.

Tomcat 6: [5]
org.apache.coyote.MAX_TRAILER_SIZE=0

Tomcat 7 and later: [6]
maxTrailerSize=""0"" on an HTTP connector


In the simplest case ""making processing of trailers an opt-in feature"" means changing the defaults for those options to be 0.

Note that setting those values to 0 does enforce the limit. It differs from ""just ignoring"" the headers. So there is a place for having a separate option.

I think that if someone is actually using trailers, a better configuration option would be a white list of expected trailer names, with non-whitelisted trailers being ignored.

1. AjpNioProtocol fails under some conditions (my post-login page)
   with packetSize larger than the default (I have tried 65536, 32768,
   16184, and 8200). The failing page is ~30k in size, enough to
   exceed the default packet size but not e.g. maximum 64k

2. Using AjpProtocol (BIO) connector solves the problem

3. Using the default AJP packet size (8192) solves the problem

4. Specifying socket.appReadBufSize and socket.appWriteBufSize to be
the same as the packet size solves the problem

I'm still working on a small test case to help motivate debugging.

Patch for tomcat v7.0.x

In the current implementation of the tomcatAuthentication parameter, this allows the REMOTE_USER variable from the webserver to be used as the principal for the tomcat request.

A side effect of this option is that if the web application uses roles (authorization), the roles will be silently ignored, and the user will be locked out.

This limits the usefulness of tomcatAuthentication.

The attached patches introduce the tomcatAuthorization flag. When true, the REMOTE-USER will be used as the principal, while authorization will continue in Tomcat as normal.

What this means practically is that it now becomes possible to place a webserver in front of a web application, and the authentication performed by the webserver will cleanly replace the authentication performed by tomcat, while leaving the web application authorization configuration intact."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57708

The standard JMX properties (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdevf) are different for enabling SSL/TLS for the RMI registry (where jmxrmi is registered) and the JMX RMI server (which carries the JMX operations), being com.sun.management.jmxremote.registry.ssl and com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl respectively.
When 55017 was done, the RMI server factories thus created were used in creating the RMI registry (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/catalina/mbeans/JmxRemoteLifecycleListener.java?revision=1498340&view=markup, line number 274)
This works fine as long as we are not using SSL and I guess this is one of the reasons Alexey Noskov said ""rmiBindAddress incompatible with rmiSSL"".

This side effect was noticed in bug# 56039 and was fixed to allow RMI registry clients to use com.sun.jndi.rmi.factory.socket.

Recommendation:
Would it be possible to have separate RMIServerSocketFactory for JMX/RMI and RMI registry, one dictated by com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl (which results in the rmiSSL flag) and the other by com.sun.management.jmxremote.registry.ssl.

This way the agent will be more compliant and we'd still have the ability to leave the RMI registry non SSL (which is to get the JMX/RMI connection stub).

We can also fix the ""rmiBindAddress incompatible with rmiSSL"" problem by creating a custom SslRMIServerSocketFactory (basically extending the one in JDK and re-implementing the createServerSocket method to use the given rmiBindAddress.

I'd be happy to do these changes, and can provide the changed version of this file, if this request seems reasonable. May be a patch as well if I learn SVN quickly.

PS: The whole reason I reached here is that we in our products use custom JMX authentication and SSL/TLS implementation. We implement the jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs approach to inject our SSL factories for JMXConnnectorServer. This recently broke because we have no control over how the server socket for RMI registry is created. We ended up setting com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl to false to avoid this JMXRemoteLifecycleListener to stop doing SSL anywhere."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57377

For example:
foo_a##001 and foo_b##001 are deployed.
Page on /foo_a/test.jsp calls ServletContext.getContext(""/foo_b"").  In non parallel deployments this returns the ServletContext for ""/foo_b"". However in parallel deployments the ServletContext for ""/"" is returned instead.

This was encountered using a custom filter that is set to forward certain requests to files in one application to a central default application.

CrossContext is set to true for the context.xml.  This works as long as the wars do not use the version name such as foo_b.war instead of foo_b##001.war.

I would expect ServletContext.getContext(""/foo_b"") to return the current active context for a URL.  Instead it looks like it will require to specify the exact version of a context instead such as ServletContext.getContext(""/foo_b##001"").  

This puts the burden of finding the active version of the context on the calling application rather than the underlying servlet container to provide the most current context when ServletContext.getContext(String) is referenced."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57190

If you want to search the system as the logged in user for roles:

userSubTree = true

This works fine and you can bind as a user, but searching fails.  Search fails because there's no user credentials to bind with and binding anonymously is disabled.  If you have isRoleSearchAsUser turned on the expectation

protected User getUser(DirContext context, String username, String credentials, int curUserPattern) 
does not add the binding user credentials for searching.  A VERY simple fix around line 1297 is to do the following so that searches work with the bound user:


  // Use pattern or search for user entry
            if (userPatternFormatArray != null && curUserPattern >= 0) {

There's probably a cleaner way to do this, but this is how I've managed to get things working at this point.  I'd imagine a property ""userSearchDNPattern"" could be added so that you can specify the pattern for the DN to bind with.  And switch the ""userCredentialsAdd"" to use that userSearchDNPattern"" instead.  With the above fix binding as a user and role lookups now work.

eg. We have an embedded server created and started something like:

 org.apache.catalina.Engine engine engine = embedded.createEngine();
 engine.setName("""");
 embedded.setContainer(engine);
 embedded.addEngine(engine);

 ...

 String startPathContextRoot = ""c:\website\data\startPath"";
 org.apache.catalina.Context startPathContext = embedded.createContext(""/startPath"",startPathContextRoot);

 embedded.start()

Then a request to http://host:port//startPath returns 404.
Whereas at Tomcat 7.0.52 it returns what we would expect from a request to 
http://host:port/startPath.
The same behaviour is seen with requests to extended URLs eg:
  http://host:port//startPath/anotherPath.
where they end up at the servlet as expected with 7.0.53 and not with 7.0.54

Debugging this a bit I found that the problem was introduced at 7.0.53 and by the changes under 
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56501
which for Tomcat 7 were revision 
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1594028
If I run our app without these changes in at 7.0.54 then it works fine.

Looking at the changes in the revision I saw some tests were added and so I tried adding some new tests to tomcat/trunk/test/org/apache/catalina/connector/TestRequest.java which I think example the problem:

    @Test
    public void testBug56501p() throws Exception {
        doBug56501(""/path"", ""//path"", ""/path"");
    }

    @Test
    public void testBug56501q() throws Exception {
        doBug56501(""/path"", ""//path/"", ""/path"");
    }

    @Test
    public void testBug56501r() throws Exception {
        doBug56501(""/path"", ""//path/bob"", ""/path"");
    }

    @Test
    public void testBug56501s() throws Exception {
        doBug56501(""/path"", ""//path/bob/"", ""/path"");

If I run these at 7.0.53 they pass.
and running at 7.0.54 they fail with:

Testcase: testBug56501p took 0.307 sec

I can try and create this with a simple servlet/setup if required if the test additions are not enough.

But the path is empty, so the offset is zero, and we end up with an extra ""/"" at the start of the servlet path. This causes the servlet mapping to not be matched.

This is ultimately due to these lines in MapperListener.registerContext():

        String contextPath = context.getPath();
        if (""/"".equals(contextPath)) {
            contextPath = """";
        }

        mapper.addContextVersion(host.getName(), host, contextPath,
                context.getWebappVersion(), context, welcomeFiles, resources,
                wrappers);

In earlier Tomcat versions, the same context object was used to get the context path in both ApplicationContext.getRequestDispatcher() and Mapper.map().  In Tomcat 8 ApplicationContext.getRequestDispatcher() uses a StandardContext object (with path=""/""), while Mapper.map() uses a ContextVersion object (with path="""")."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57216

Small app to reproduce the problem

If an error is sent as part of some asynchronous processing, for example:

@WebServlet(value = ""/async"", asyncSupported=true)
public class AsyncServlet extends HttpServlet {
       
	protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		final AsyncContext context = request.startAsync();
		context.start(new Runnable() {
			@Override
			public void run() {
				try {
					response.sendError(500);
				} catch (IOException e) {
				}
				context.complete();
			}
		});
	}
}

Tomcat 7.0.57 renders its default error page rather than the configured custom error page. The same behaviour is also exhibited in recent 8.0.x releases. It's perhaps worth noting that Tomcat 7.0.55 renders an entirely blank page in this scenario.

My expectation is that the custom error page is used and, FWIW, this is what Jetty does.

I have attached a war that can be used to reproduce the problem. /sync can be used to confirm that the custom error page is working. /async will reproduce the problem described above."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57252

Looking at the current sources of Spring Boot, the org.springframework.boot.context.web.ErrorPageFilter class is not public, but package-visible. Reflection call fails, as Java Language rules prohibit access to that class.

Such filter cannot be configured via web.xml (as its constructor is not accessible), but can be configured programmatically via ServletContext.addFilter(String, Filter). It is a rare situation, but I think that it is a valid one.

My idea of the fix is that method lookup in catalina SecurityUtil shall not use targetObject.getClass().getMethod(..), but Filter.class.getMethod(). My expectation is that it will be allowed to invoke java.lang.reflect.Method declared by javax.servlet.Filter class on the targetObject object regardless of accessibility of targetObject class, but testing is needed.

A bonus point is that the method cache shall become smaller."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57281

The two can be different, but still allow the JVM to start up.
I found the following worked:

for Unix or the equivalent \xyz on Windows.

Using a different first character does not work - the JVM usually throws an exception as it cannot find some required files if the sep. is incorrect.

It looks like only the first character of the property is used by the JVM. However, this is not done by the application code I have seen, which means that there could be a discrepancy between the two methods.

File.separator has the additional benefit that it is not subject to a privilege check."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57308

In tomcat 7.0.x, the actual implementation prevents this behavior since the listeners list is cleared *after* firing the event (cf. AdyncContextImpl.java:366).

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.58 (violetagg)|fix|57420|Make UEncoder a local variable in DirContextURLConnection to make it threadsafe. Based on ideas from kkolinko and violetagg. (fschumacher)|Wrong class names generated since URL_ENCODER in DirContextURLConnection is not thread safe|"We've been debugging this for a long time. Sometimes when tomcat starts up, it will fail to deploy a webapp since it cannot find a certain class. That class name is always complete garbage.

The error stack trace always is:
SEVERE: Unable to process resource element [jndi:/localhost/testapp/WEB-INF/classes/ch/blabli/dNlewrP.lculgiansDisalog$3.class] for annotations
java.io.FileNotFoundException: jndi:/localhost/testapp/WEB-INF/classes/ch/blabli/dNlewrP.lculgiansDisalog$3.class
        at org.apache.naming.resources.DirContextURLConnection.getInputStream(DirContextURLConnection.java:389)

From time to time we see, that the referenced class name is actually a mix of the real class name and one or more other classes that exist in the vicinity of that class.

Finally I was able to catch this exception with the debugger.
What I see is that the problem stems from rg.apache.catalina.startup.ContextConfig.processAnnotationsJndi(ContextConfig.java:1986):
- dcUrlConn (DirContextURLConnection) contains the correct entries of the WAR file
- Enumeration<String> dirs = dcUrlConn.list()  however does not. Calling list() again from the debugger yields the correct results.

Here's the contents of that dirs variable:

[lCsosn, oCrAopnpfliigcEadtiitoonr$AEpdpiltiocraMtoidoen.$c2l.acslsass, , tCioonnfi$gu4r.aticolnaLsosad, liconaftgiuroatni$o5n.LocadlLaisstsen, cCaotnifiognur$a6.clastsi, lCaonsfsig, s, cluaiss, CwoindgfetisegtEditorApplication$9.class, ConfigEditorApplication$ApplicationConfigLoadListener.class, ConfigEditorApplication$ConfigEditorToParameterHandlerIntegration.class, ConfigEditorApplication$EditorMode$1.class, ConfigEditorApplication$EditorMode$2.class, ConfigEditorApplication$EditorMode.class, ConfigEditorApplication.class, ConfigLoader$1.class, ConfigLoader.class, ConfigurationLoadListener$ConfigType.class, ConfigurationLoadListener$ConfigurationLoadedEvent.class, ConfigurationLoadListener$FailedToLoadConfigurationEvent.class, ConfigurationLoadListener.class, command, data, field, rendering, session, ui, util, widgetset]

walking into the list() command leads to collection.list(""/"") which in turn is encoded using an URL_ENCODER (class UEncoder). This URL_ENCODER is *not* thread safe and can result in exactly such garbage if used concurrently.

It is interesting to note that every single failure we had at this step was always caused by classes in the WEB-INF/classes directory, never in JAR files in WEB-INF/lib.

To me it appears that there are two different DirContextURLConnections with rare concurrency issues when both use the same URL_ENCODER.

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.58 (violetagg)|fix|57324|If the client uses Expect: 100-continue and Tomcat responds with a non-2xx response code, Tomcat also closes the connection. If Tomcat knows the connection is going to be closed when committing the response, Tomcat will now also send the Connection: close response header. (markt)|"Change in Expect100Continue behaviour in Tomcat is breaking existing clients with ""keepalive"" connections"|"1) In the version of Tomcat 7.0.50, the behavior of Coyote handler is modified to handle ""Expect: 100-continue"" clients. To be specific look at this change in the following line, http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-coyote/7.0.50/org/apache/coyote/http11/AbstractHttp11Processor.java#1088

2) In the above change, the fix was done to handle cases against misbehaving client while POST requests are submitted to Tomcat.

3) While it is done with a ""security"" intent, the fix only takes into account status codes ranging in 2xx series. It breaks some legitimate cases where other status codes are returned for legitimate usecases. An example is given below.

Example:

   * It is quite normal to have a keepalive connections with different resources having different authorization controls
   * HTTP 401 is typical of webservers to inform clients of unauthorized access to resources and triggering client to resubmit the request. Please refer http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html for 401 behavior.
   * The change done in Tomcat breaks this legitimate case.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install a version of Tomcat 7.0.50 or above
2) Write a client that uses Expect100Continue behavior along with KeepAlive
3) Make atleast two requests with the first request succeeding and second request simulating a HTTP 401 scenario. 
4) Notice that the server closes the connection after the second response
5) This will break clients which are in the process of responding to the second request with valid credentials

Why blocker:

1) .NET defaults to Expect 100 behaviour
2) .NET clients optimize the keepalive connections and do not send credentials with every request going out on keepalive connections
3) This induces 401 situation more often in communications between Tomcat and .NET clients
4) Closing of server connections is causing existing connections to break and our customers are complaining this started happening after upgrading Tomcat (7.0.50)
5) Hence, this needs attention."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57324

Tomcat 7.0.47 NioConnector, nginx 1.6.2, atmosphere 2.2.3.

It happens when nginx and atmosphere close the same comet connection concurrently.

In NioEndpoint.Poller thread(A) the SocketChannel becomes ready for read when nginx closes it. Poller unregisters the channel for read and forks another thread(B) to handle close event. (see NioEndpoint:1239)
Then atmosphere calls close on the connection in thread(C) and Tomcat receives internal action with code ActionCode.COMET_CLOSE and adds the channel to the Poller, which registers it for read again. (see Http11NioProcessor.java:462).
The SocketChannel is still readable in case thread(B) hasn’t invalidated the SelectionKey yet, so Poller in thread(A) initiates the closing process again and forks thread(D).
Thread(B) completes the closing process and puts NioChannel and AttachmentKey into the corresponding caches. 
Then Thread(D) tries to close the channel again and realizes that it has already been closed (see AbstractProtocol.java:564) and puts the same NioChannel and AttachmentKey into caches.

Repeat JSP file

When using the Tomcat websocket client to connect to a websocket server from a servlet running with a SecurityManager, an AccessControlException is thrown even with a Java security policy that allows everything.

This is an issue with the fix for bug 57091, which does not work when the websocket client is used where access to the ""org.apache.tomcat."" packages is restricted (as it is in the Catalina servlet container).

Repeat using unmodified Tomcat 8.0.17 and JDK 8u31 in Win7 x64:

 1) Add the following at the end of $CATALINA_BASE/conf/catalina.policy:

    grant {
      permission java.security.AllPermission;
    };

 2) Put the attached JSP file (repeat.jsp) into $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/examples/jsp
    (The repeat opens a websocket client to the echo websocket example server, 
    sends a text message and then waits for and outputs the echoed response.)

 3) Launch Tomcat from $CATALINA_BASE/bin with ""catalina run -security""

 4) Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/examples/jsp/repeat.jsp in a web browser

Expected results:

 Output ""Response from echo: Hello World!"" in the browser.

Actual results:

 An exception is printed to the console, and no output in the browser (until timeout).

 (The repeat is of course artificial. In reality the websocket client is used outside of the servlet page rendering, but the same exception occurs.)

The fix for bug 57091 tried to overcome the limitations of the InnocuousThread that serves the completion handler, by wrapping the implementation of AsyncChannelGroupUtil.AsyncIOThreadFactory.newThread in a privileged block. However, due to the null protection domain of InnocuousThread, the method is in this case not even allowed to load its own anonymous PrivilegedAction class!

The anonymous class is called ""org.apache.tomcat.websocket.AsyncChannelGroupUtil$AsyncIOThreadFactory$1"", which triggers the check for the ""accessClassInPackage.org.apache.tomcat.websocket"" runtime permission. Normally this permission is granted to all code by catalina.policy, but the InnocuousThread has no permissions regardless of policy.

A dirty workaround is to uncomment this line at the top of the JSP code:

  Class.forName(""org.apache.tomcat.websocket.AsyncChannelGroupUtil$AsyncIOThreadFactory$1"");

Then the anonymous class is loaded by the application class loader at a time when there are permissions to do so (i.e. outside of the InnocuousThread), and the repeat will then work without exception (even after commenting out this line again, as long as Tomcat isn't restarted).

Running Tomcat without ""-security"" also makes the repeat work without exception.

There is an open OpenJDK issue about the InnocuousThread being used for the completion handler (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8051403), but it would be good if this could be fixed in Tomcat until (or if not) the JDK is fixed.

One fix is to use a non-anonymous PrivilegedAction in AsyncChannelGroupUtil.AsyncIOThreadFactory.newThread and then force it to be loaded when AsyncChannelGroupUtil.AsyncIOThreadFactory is initialized, by accessing the class in a static initializer:

http://markmail.org/message/4iplahbcanujbqoo

The Manager application has commands that display distribution of sessions according to their idle time. (The commands are ""/text/sessions"", ""/text/expire"" in Test GUI and ""Expire Sessions"" button in HTML GUI.)

The commands display how many sessions have idle time <1 minute, from 1 up to 2 minutes (1 - <2), from 2 to 3 (2 - <3) and so on.

Lets assume that a web application is configured with session-timeout of 30 minutes. Before r1614165 (in 7.0.56)/r1614163 (in 8.0.11) the last time slot in that statistics was labeled "">= 30"". In those revisions it was fixed to be labeled ""29 - <30"".

Actually it should have been labeled "">= 29"", as sessions that have idle time more than 30 minutes are actually added to the value,

 else if (time >= maxCount)
 timeout[maxCount-1]++; 

It would be better to count outdated sessions in a separate time slot, so that  ""29 - <30"" and "">=30"" were two distinct numbers.

One may see "">=30"" sessions if the thread that performs expiration have not run yet (or is stuck).


An incorrect configuration to test this behaviour:
1. Configure examples application with the following text in its web.xml

 <session-config>
  <session-timeout>2</session-timeout>
 </session-config> 
and the following META-INF/context.xml
 <Context backgroundProcessorDelay=""10""/>

2. Configure a user with roles manager-script and manager-gui. Start Tomcat.

3. Visit example webapp -> Servlet examples -> Session example to create a session.

4. Visit http://localhost:8080/manager/html, click on sessions number on the row for the examples webapp. A list of sessions opens. Use it to check idle time of the session.

5. Visit http://localhost:8080/manager/text/sessions?path=/examples to see sessions statistics.

6. Wait for 2 minutes.
Expected output of /text/sessions command is that you have a session that is idle for more than 2 minutes.

Actual output is ""1 - <2 minutes: 1 sessions"""|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57323

Minor issue fixed by the way:
due to missing <exclude name=""*.asc""> the apache-tomcat-8.0.15-embed.tar.gz archive contains apache-tomcat-8.0.15-embed.zip.asc file that does not belong there.


Is it worth to add sha2 (sha-512)? I have some questions:

My issues with sha-512:
=========================
1) Is it worth adding sha-512?
Generally users shall use PGP signatures for verification, not the checksums.

2) Not many ASF projects are providing sha2 checksums.
One that I know is Apache Ant,

http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Looking at Apache Ant, I have several notes:

a) *.sha512 files are not copied to mirrors, so ASF mirror system knows how to skip these files. (Good)

b) when I click on the link to a file, browser (Firefox 34) does not display the file, but prompts to download it. (Unexpected)

Looking at response headers in Firefox, the server sends Content-Type: application/zip for *.zip.sha512, application/x-gzip for *.tar.gz.sha512, application/x-bzip2 for *.tar.bz2.

So the server is not configured for these files. It sends text/plain for *.sha1 files.


3) I do not have a command-line tool to automatically verify sha-512.

There exist sha512sum from GNU,
http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#sha2-utilities

but GnuWin32 CoreUtils do not have this tool.


4) What file format shall we use?

Apache Ant downloads are using  hashsum + LF.

We are using  hashsum + "" *"" + filename, which is the format supported by md5sum and sha1sum GNU utilities.

`openssl dgst -sha512 filename` generates ""SHA512("" + filename + "")= "" +hashsum +LF, but I think that openssl does not read this format.

I think it would better to print just the hashsum value, but I wonder if that is supported by sha512sum tool."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57344

Tomcat is configured according to the ""Windows Authentication How-To"" document, I'm attaching the krb5.ini, jaas.conf and server.xml that contains the JNDIRealm definition.

I have investigated the problem and I believe it is related to the Kerberos constraint delegation support added in Java 8, see:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/jgss-features.html
http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6355584

It seems that per default, GSS API in Java 8 will attempt constraint delegation on the acceptor side, see referenced changes and in particular the getCredDelegState() method:
http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/rev/a1bbb8805e22

The result of this, is that Tomcat's JNDIRealm now finds the delegated credential delivered with the constraint delegation and switches GSSAPI security mechanism for JNDI/LDAP (this was not the case on Java 7). However, the Kerberos initiation during LDAP authentication does not find the Kerberos TGT in the Subject. After digging further, I noticed that the Subject used during the LDAP authentication is not set. Though the SpnegoAuthenticator initializes a Subject instance using Kerberos login via JAAS and this contains the obtained TGT, this Subject instance is not used for performing the LDAP authentication. I saw the following comment in JNDIRealm.getPrincipal:

// Note: Subject already set in SPNEGO authenticator so no need for Subject.doAs() here

So I decided to modify this and execute the getPrincipal using Subject.doAs() and the Subject instance available after the Kerberos login. This lead to successful authentication to LDAP and I was able to access the Spnego-secured webapp again.

Please note that this setup is not using any file-system Kerberos credential cache, so it requires that the Kerberos TGT is available in the Subject instance associated with current ACC."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57022

I was backporting a test for BZ 54928 from Tomcat 8 to Tomcat 7 and noted a difference in output. The code was:

 log.info(""Exception caught "" + e.getMessage());

In Tomcat 7 (7.0.56+) it resulted in
 ""Exception caught null""
while on Tomcat 8 (8.0.14+) it was
 ""Exception caught Software caused connection abort: socket write error"".

When I changed the code to use e.toString() it became:
in Tomcat 7:
 ""Exception caught ClientAbortException:  java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: socket write error""
in Tomcat 8:
 ""Exception caught org.apache.catalina.connector.ClientAbortException: java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection abort: socket write error""


The difference comes from r1360468. Essentially Tomcat 8 delegates processing to original implementations in java.lang.Throwable, while the old code in Tomcat 7 has its own implementation of getMessage() and toString().

There are two differences:

a) The Throwable(Throwable cause) constructor in Java initializes message as cause.toString() while in ClientAbortException(Throwable) the message defaults to being null.

b) Throwable.toString() uses the fully qualified name of a class, while ClientAbortException.toString() prints just ""ClientAbortException""."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57144

Since the JSP parser only sees a ""single"" import and believes it has merely written a single import line, the SMAP numbering ends up being off by, in this case, 12, causing all sorts of fun down the line when trying to map back to original jsp code by way of the SMAP file.

The problem is actually in the JVM which installs a null protection domain which fails every access checked operation.  Apparantly Oracle won't fix this, according to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-332, but there is a workaround which is fairly easy.  It is modelled after the fix to the SSHD one found in the link above.

The actual implementation in org.apache.tomcat.websocket.WsRemoteEndpointBasic.sendObject(Object) does not throw that exception, because the method that is called there does not throw it. It is not even declares a ""throws"" for it, and it is a checked exception.

It is generated from template in modules/jdbc-pool/resources/MANIFEST.MF 

Expected behaviour:
1) I expected ""Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.8.4"", because that was the version of Ant used to build Tomcat 8.0.14.
""Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.7.0"" is hard-coded in template file.

2) ""Bundle-Version: 1.1.0.1"" and versions in ""Export-Package"" to be 8.0.14.
The goal is to discern different builds of JDBC Pool.
I guess it boils down to passing relevant ${version} property when invoking its build file from Tomcat one.

Can we change that ""1.1.0.1"" to be ""8.0.14"", or there will be any problems?

Based on a patch by Sheldon Shao. (violetagg)|Avoid throwing NameNotFoundException in BaseDirContext#lookup()|"Created attachment 31848 [details]
The issue

NameNotFoundException is thrown when the resource can't be found in this DirContext.

In the method BaseDirContext, it also goes through all the alternate or backup DirContexts to lookup the resource one by one until the resource is found.
A NameNotFoundException is thrown in the alternate DirContext when the given resource name isn't in this DirContext.

﻿  public final Object lookup(String name) throws NamingException {
        // First check for aliases
        if (!aliases.isEmpty()) {
            AliasResult result = findAlias(name);
            if (result.dirContext != null) {
                return result.dirContext.lookup(result.aliasName);
            }
        }
        
        // Next do a standard lookup
        Object obj = doLookup(name);

        if (obj != null)
            return obj;
        
        // Check the alternate locations

                obj = altDirContext.lookup(""/META-INF/resources"" + name);
                if (obj != null)

            } catch ( NamingException ex) {

It takes much CPU time.   It could be optimized by checking result is null or not.

(markt)|Applications with uppercase context paths cannot be updated|"Tomcat 8.0.12 cannot update applications with uppercase context paths if the application is deployed as a compressed WAR file.

For the bug to occur, two deployments are required (let's call them v1 and v2).

Deployment v1 goes through fine.  Both the WAR and unpacked directory are updated.

Deployment v2 succeeds, but the application continues to serve v1.  The webapps WAR file is updated, but the unpacked app directory is not.

I traced the issue to HostConfig.java line 1226:

1225: String docBase = context.getDocBase();
1226:   docBase = docBase.toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH);
1227:   if (!docBase.endsWith("".war"")) {

...
1237:   }

The lowercase context path is passed to ExpandWar.delete, so the unpacked dir is not deleted on case-sensitive filesystems.  Tomcat reports a successful deployment of v2 in the Manager interface.

The toLowerCase call should be moved into the if statement, or bound to a separate variable.  The original case-sensitive docBase path must be passed to ExpandWar.delete."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56938

""Remove this Session from the active Sessions for this Manager, but not from the Store.""

The implementation of remove in PersistentManagerBase has the following comment:
""Remove this Session from the active Sessions for this Manager, and from the Store.""

The comment here implies that the container uses this method to identify a servlet that is declared with a jsp-file attribute. However, tomcat actually uses the init-param ""jspFile"" on a copy of the JspServlet with the name of the target jsp instead.

If a container sets this attribute as per the comment, it can cause stack overflow when jsp including is used:

 a.jsp is defined in a jsp-file on a servlet in web.xml
 a.jsp includes b.jsp

When a.jsp is serviced it does an include dispatch to b.jsp. When the JspServlet is called for b.jsp, it sees that the request attribute with a.jsp is set, so processes it again ... which does an include dispatch for b.jsp ... which causes a.jsp to be processed again .... and then rinse and repeat.

Note that Glassfish nulls out this attribute after it has been detected:

  if (jspFile != null) {
            // JSP is specified via <jsp-file> in <servlet> declaration

2. Visit ""Echo"" websockets example and do the following

- Select any connection option
(I like ""(*) annotation API (stream)"", but the issue is reproducible with any of the 3 connection options)
- Press ""Connect"" button
- Press ""Echo message"" button
- Press ""Disconnect"" button

3. Touch file webapps\examples\WEB-INF\web.xml and wait for the web application to be reloaded by Tomcat

Actual: Webapp reloading completes successfully, but a ""Unable to destroy WebSocket thread group"" warning is logged into logs/catalina.2014-08-31.log file:

1) Reproduction rate is less than 100%. Sometimes the warning does not happen. Steps 2-4 can be repeated without restarting Tomcat until the issue shows itself.
In the example, any connection option can be used. The issue does not depend on it.

2) The message is printed by org.apache.tomcat.websocket.server.WsServerContainer.destroy() method and originates from r1589043

3) I tried to get more information, by adding the following debug code:
[[[
            StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
            buf.append(threadGroup.getName());
            buf.append("" activeCount: "").append(threadGroup.activeCount());
            buf.append("" isDestroyed: "").append(threadGroup.isDestroyed());
            Thread[] threads = new Thread[100];
            int threadCount = threadGroup.enumerate(threads, false);
            buf.append(""\nactual Thread count: "").append(threadCount);
            for (int i=0; i<threadCount; i++) {
                buf.append(""\n\n"").append(threads[i]);
                StackTraceElement[] stack = threads[i].getStackTrace();
                for (StackTraceElement ste: stack) {
                    buf.append(""\n\t"").append(ste);
                }
            }
            log.warn(buf.toString());
]]]

The results:
1. activeCount: 0 isDestroyed: false
2. actual Thread count: 0, threadGroup.enumerate() have not returned any thread.
3. If I add second threadGroup.destroy(); call after the above code, it succeeds.

4) There are no PermGen memory leaks. (No thread stack traces are printed by WebappClassLoader leak detection code. No leaks detected by Find leaks command in Tomcat Manager webapp).

Missing a ThreadGroup.destroy() call will keep this thread group in its parent thread group's list, so there will be a small java object leak.

5) In this case we were safe, but generally there might be threads that are still running, as they perform some web application code.
So the warning is justified.

Thoughts on a possible fix
==========
1) Use threadGroup.setDaemon(true) [1].

The daemon flag on a thread group means that its destroy() method will be called automatically when its thread count reaches zero.

Generally it either shall be done in a synchronized(threadGroup) block, or we shall call some synchronized methods later to make sure that the change is propagated. (E.g. calling ThreadGroup.isDestroyed(), ThreadGroup.activeCount() is good for this).

The goal is to avoid the java object leak.

[1] http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadGroup.html#setDaemon%28boolean%29

2) Ask for threadGroup.activeCount() and include the count in the warning message."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56905

patch

I'm integrating LiveRebel (http://liverebel.com) with Tomcat. I need a clean way how to get Tomcat scripts to start LiveRebel agent instead of Tomcat (the agent will be responsible for starting Tomcat).

Currently we are patching Tomcat scripts (catalina.sh/bat and setclasspath.sh/bat); however, that is messy, as every time user updates Tomcat, those changes get overwritten.

Instead, I would like to change the ""java"" executable that Tomcat scripts use to start Tomcat.

My current solution is to set _RUNJAVA environment variable in CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh/bat and then patch CATALINA_HOME/bin/setclasspath.sh/bat not to override the setting if already set (see the attached patch).
This solution is also described here:

set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %OTHER_STUFF%

However, this leads to issues if the existing JAVA_OPTS had some sort of escape sequence in it.  For example, in my setenv.bat, I add some proxy info:

SET ""JAVA_OPTS=-Dhttp.proxyHost=myproxy.localdomain -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=*.localdomain^|localhost^|appserver.localdomain""

Using the existing approach, the escape sequence ^| gets processed into | leaving the next evaluation to treat it as a command pipe, which causes immediate failure.

If instead you use this approach:

set ""JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %OTHER_STUFF%""

Then those escape sequences are preserved.  Here is the patch for version 7.0.54:

source code to reproduce the issue

If using jsf 2 project and add Phase Listeners there, they are created and added to the list of Phase Listeners twice which means on page load same Phase Listeners are executed twice.

Without such declaration in web.xml jsf is initialized one time.

Such behaviour can be very critical for applications using jsf and Phase Listeners. And Maybe not only Phase Listeners are duplicated(didn't look), because the problem here is that jsf is initialized twice and other things can get duplicated too.

Patch for tomcat 8

Currently when a servlet with load-on-startup >=0 fails its startup, the context startup is still considered as OK.
With some webapps (like spring-based ones with a DispatcherServlet), this makes no sense at all : if the servlet failed its startup, the webapp is unuseable and it would be more sensible to have tomcat mark the context as failed.

Such a behavior is not specified in JEE specs, so I propose to have a new optional flag on Context and Host containers.

In the attached patch, the flag is named failDeploymentIfServletLoadedOnStartupFails . If specified on Context, it overrides the value potentially specified at the Host level.

The proposed patch for tomcat 8 passes checkstyle, provides a unit test and updates documentation.

In Tomcat 8 Jasper now initializes itself via JasperInitializer.onStartup() and adds TLD listeners via ServletContext.addListener(String) calls.

host.contextList.contexts = newContexts;             
// Recalculate nesting                               
host.contextList.nesting = 0;                        
for (int i = 0; i < newContexts.length; i++) {       
    int slashCount = slashCount(newContexts[i].name);
    if (slashCount > host.contextList.nesting) {     
        host.contextList.nesting = slashCount;       
    }                                                
}                                                    
]]]

The problem is there is a delay between when the list of contexts is updated (contextList.contexts) and the contextList.nesting field is updated. The ""nesting"" field is used when mapping contexts.

For example,
1. If there are the following contexts:
ROOT
foo
foo#bar

2. Context foo#bar is being stopped.

3. A request for ""foo"" comes in, e.g. http://localhost/foo/index.html
Expected behaviour: Map the context to foo application.
Actual behaviour:
It may be that the request will be erroneously mapped to the ROOT webapp instead of ""foo"".

The issue is that MapperListener.registerContext() is implemented as

[[[
        mapper.addContextVersion(...);
        for (Container container : context.findChildren()) {
            registerWrapper((Wrapper) container);
        }
]]]

It registers a context first, then registers it wrappers.  So there is a time slot when the Context have already been registered in the Mapper, but its Wrappers are not yet registered there.  If a request comes it, it can be mapped to a wrong servlet.

In CoyoteAdapter.postParseRequest there is code that protects from this issue when a Context is being reloaded.
- An ""if (request.getContext().getPaused())"" check.

In case if Context is deployed on an already running server, there is no protection.

I think the way to fix this it to amend the Mapper.addContextVersion() method and pass wrapper mappings to it. In this case the Mapper should be create a correct full configuration for a web application at once.

Alternatively, we may change the default value of StandardContext.paused flag to be ""true"" and switch it to ""false"" when the context has already started up.

Alternatively, we may check Context state in CoyoteAdapter.postParseRequest. Can this get rid of the ""started"" flag?"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56658

2) There is a servlet that is mapped to context root using URL pattern """" (empty string) - per Servlet 3.0 mrel spec chapter 12.2 Specification of Mappings

Then whenever Tomcat tries to compile a JSP page, it fails when trying to validate effective merged web.xml against the schema.

WORKAROUND:
To work around the issue I disabled XML validation for this specific context, via <Context xmlValidation=""false""/>

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Add the following mapping at the end of webapps/examples/WEB-INF/web.xml:
[[[
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>RequestInfoExample</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern />

2. Configure Tomcat in ""strict compliance"" mode by adding the following line to conf/catalina.properties:
org.apache.catalina.STRICT_SERVLET_COMPLIANCE=true

3. Purge the work/ directory to remove compiled JSPs, if there are any.
4. Start Tomcat

5. Access http://localhost:8080/examples/
The ""Request Information Example"" page is shown. Thus the empty URL mapping is working correctly.

6. Access a JSP page, http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/jsp2/el/basic-arithmetic.jsp
Expected: Some arithmetics demo page

I see the following issues with the code that clears the cookie in SingleSignOn.invoke():

1). The cookie value is echoed back.
To clear a cookie it should be enough to use any fixed value.

(OP concerns are that Secure and HttpOnly flags are not set on the Set-Cookie header. It should not be an issue, as the value is known to be invalid, and as browser is expected to immediately remove the cookie. Still I can agree that it is not pretty).

2) The Domain and Path attributes should have the same values as for a newly created SSO cookie.

(The new cookie replaces the old cookie if it has the same name, domain and path. - RFC 6265 page 24
- Chapter 5.3. Storage Model, item 11)


BTW, an unrelated issue:
The code in SingleSignOn.invoke() operates on the first SSO cookie that it finds. It does not expect browser to send several cookies with this name."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56666

The second stack trace with ""MapperListener.startInternal()"" is the expected one. The same stack trace is observed during the first tomcat.start().

The first stack trace with ""MapperListener.lifecycleEvent()"" is an unexpected one. It is caused by the lifecycle listener still being registered on Host.

The MapperListener.startInternal() method contains line
> addListeners(engine);

As listeners are stored in a list, it means that the same listener will be added the second time. I expect that if one adds the thirds tomcat.start() call to the test case, it will cause Mapper.addHost() to be called three times.


That said, I think there is not much of a problem from calling addHost() more than once for the same host (e.g. Mapper.addContextVersion() may call it silently). Thus I'll change Mapper.addHost() to do not treat such repeated calls as an error."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56717

WEBAPP LOGIC:
the simplified situation:
1. call ""req.startAsync()"" to start async serlvet, then execute the async logic in our user thread.
2. sometimes the user thread be interrupted (by some timeout logic of our code).
3. some user code call ""resp.flushBuffer()"" to send response to client

when the connections limit latch count up to max ( default ""10000"" ),
tomcat DO not accept any connection, all incoming client hangs.

in a clean tomcat-7.0.53 installation:
1. change the default ""server.xml"" Connector config.
(1) change protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol""
(2) Optional, add maxConnections=""100"" to reproduce the bug faster.
2. copy the sample webapp in the attachment to ""webapps/ROOT.war""
3. start tomcat.
4. make plenty request to ""/async.html"", 

for (( i = 0; i < 15000; ++i )) ; do echo $i; curl localhost:8080/async.html; done

each request is likely cause a limit latch leak.
when the requests reaches maxConnections (100 as we set above) or some more,
the client ( curl ) hangs.

TECHNIC-DETAILS:
after some debug, wo found these:

1. when the thread was interrupted, when the user code call ""resp.flushBuffer()"",
the NioChannel was Closed by jdk NIO code, and a ClosedByInterruptException is thrown.

2. when the channel closed, the SelectionKey was removed by Poller thread, 
stack trace:

3. when we call ""ctx.complete()"", it run to ""org.apache.tomcat.util.net.NioEndpoint.processSocket(NioChannel, SocketStatus, boolean)"", code is below:

    public boolean processSocket(NioChannel socket, SocketStatus status, boolean dispatch) {
        try {
            KeyAttachment attachment = (KeyAttachment)socket.getAttachment(false);
            if (attachment == null) {
                return false;
            }

since the SelectionKey was removed, the ""attachment"" returns null.
the logic is break, ""AbstractEndpoint.countDownConnection()"" is not called, a limit latch leak happens.

WORK-AROUND:
some work-around:
1. switch to the stable BIO connector.
2. avoid call ""resp.flushBuffer()"" in the user thread."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56518

test.jsp

(Reproducible with the current trunk @1598763

If there is a JSP page that generates a lot of text and then encounters an error, the client receives only 8K*n bytes of text. The last chunk of text - before the actual place of the error is lost and not sent to the client.

To reproduce:
1. Deploy the attached test.jsp and call it.
2. Actual behaviour:
The last line of text is ""970 "".
If you save the result, it will be 16384 (16 Kb) (with LF line ends).

Expected behaviour:
The last line of text is ""1000 Hello world!"".

My motivation for this enhancement request is that seeing all the text before the error place would make it easier to locate the error.

Also the lost ~8K of text may contain something valuable for the client.

The current workaround is to look into localhost.date.log for the actual stack trace. The stacktrace is for generated java file. It may contain a JSP source snippet, but not always."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56581

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.54 (violetagg)|fix|56027|Add more options for managing FIPS mode in the AprLifecycleListener. (schultz/kkolinko)|Unable to use TCN on RHEL6 boxes if box is booted in fips mode|"There are two problems here.

#1) A RHEL6 box can be configured to boot in FIPS 140 mode automatically, and the underlying openssl packages will detect this when they initialize.  If Tomcat is configured to use the APR listener with 'FIPSMode=""on""' set, then the APRLifecycleListener in initializeSSL calls down to TCN to explicitly do a fipsModeSet.  However, *if* a RHEL box is configured to be in fips mode at boot then this call will fail in the openssl libraries, where it claims that fips mode is already set. Looking at the openssl source (openssl-1.0.0-27.el6.src.rpm) the FIPS_mode_set() call does not allow for being 'set' more than once.  Putting a check in TCN src/ssl.c in the fipsModeCheck() to see if the mode is already set solves this one.

#2) Second issue is in the SSL_TMP_KEYS_INIT macro (called from the TCN src/ssl.c initialize() method) looks like it trying to pre-initialize a 512 bit RSA key.  This key appears to be invalid (the underlying ssl_tmp_key_init_rsa() call fails), and this winds up with the entire initialize code throwoing an error about this platform having an unsupported function and exiting.  Deleting the 512 RSA init line solves this one.

Not sure the best solution for #2.  Discussing with a few folks here indicated that a 512 bit RSA key is invalid for FIPS mode, so perhaps this call needs to be wrapped in a 'if (FIPS_Mode()==0)' check.  Out of my depth there on the best solution.

My initial debug wound up exposing the FIPS_Mode() call thru JNI so the AprLifecycleListner class could check this and display an intelligent message, but this would involve changes to both TC6/7(/8?) as well as TCN, and may not be worth that extra involvement."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56027

Improve documentation. (kkolinko)|Simplify use of Mapper in StandardJarScanner|"Looking at the code that performs jar names filtering in StandardJarScanner in 8.0.5, 7.0.53.

This is in view of
a) backporting it to Tomcat 6 to get rid of ecj-xxx.jar names in the lists of ignored files there,
b) documenting what filename patterns are supported here.

Essentially, the code calls ""Matcher.matchPath(toSkip, jarName)"" (see StandardJarScanFilter#check() in 8.0.5) where jarName is just a file name.

This is an overkill. The matchPath() method is designed to work with Ant-style patterns matching against file paths. This method handles file names hierarchy (directory names and ""**"" directory name pattern).  The actual matching of the names is performed by Matcher.match(String pattern, String str, boolean caseSensitive), which is a rather more simple API.

Thus the proposal is to get rid of Matcher.matchPath() and call Matcher.match() directly. This allows to remove a lot of unneeded code.

For documentation, the file name patterns supported by Matcher.match() according to its javadoc are as follows:
 * The pattern may contain two special characters:<br>

So, this tells us, the url-pattern '*.jsp' forwards all requests ending with '.jsp' to the mapped servlet or filtes. With this, one might also assume that the url-pattern '*.my.txt' forwards all requests ending with 'my.txt' to the configured servlet or filters. But the latter does not work with Tomcat.

I set up a tiny maven project, for illustrating the problem: https://bitbucket.org/benplocek/servlet-extension-mapping-test

This project contains a Servlet and a Filter, both mapped to '.my.html':

  <servlet-mapping>

This servlet will show the version information from ServerInfo when the
listings are enabled. Currently it seems there is no way of disabling
version reporting other than 'hacking' the ServerInfo.

There is a way to customize those listings: define an XSLT style sheet.

That said, it is possible to introduce a configuration option for DefaultServlet.

Classes that hold a reference to WebappClassLoader

I have a problem with unloading casses of a web application when I stop it.
All threads are closed, but all 6.000 classes remain in memory. The GC cannot destroy WebappClassLoader because it is held by a static hashMap of the naming services which is hold by the VM.

See attached image.

The problem occurs only when the application uses the naming service. I identified the first method in my application that triggers the problem: 

public class MyBindAuthenticator extends BindAuthenticator {
    ...
    @Override
    public DirContextOperations authenticate(Authentication authentication) {
        ...
        List<String> userns=getUserDns(username);
        ...
    }
    ...
}

When I replace this line by a hardcoded list of strings, then the problem gets triggered by the next call of any naming service method. When I replace the whole authenticate() method by an empty one, then the problem disappears. But I need it for security reason.

Unfortunately, the problematic hashmap (with name securityTokens) is not accessible to me, so I cannot remove the references. I seems that all related classes are part of Catalina and not reachable from outside.

(markt)|HttpSessionBindingListener.valueUnbound uses wrong classloader when SingleSignOn valve is used|"Created attachment 31630 [details]
Reproduction war (including sources inside)

We are encountering an issue with the call to the valueUnbound listener of our application. We rely on the SingleSignOn valve (org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn) to invalidate all user sessions for all web applications when the user chooses to logout (session invalidate) on one webapp.

It seems that the valueUnboud is always called with the WebappClassLoader of the application where the original Session.invalidate was called. In the SingleSignOn scenario this is not always the webappclassloader.

I have added reproduction steps and .wars below.

It seems that the HttpSessionListener methods _are_ being called with the correct classloader from org.apache.catalina.session.StandardSession.expire(boolean). The expire method holds functionality to set the classloader to the webapp classloader, and restore it after calling. In the patch i have moved the classloader restore code down. This makes that also the valueUnbound calls are now done using the right webappclassloader. But i am not sure if this is valid as also a number of internal calls are being executed in the process. 
I will add the patch in the comments as i can only add a single attachment it seems.

= Reproduction =
I have created a very small demo project (code to be found in the war).

== Preparation ==
- Use a Tomcat 7 runtime.
- Make sure you can login with a user that gets role 'test' by editing <tomcat>/conf/tomcat-users.xml.
- Make sure SingleSignOn valve is enabled in server.xml
- Place SingleSignOut.war in <tomcat>/webapps/
- Make a copy of this <tomcat>/webapps/SingleSignOut.war to <tomcat>/webapps/SingleSignOut2.war
(now you have two web applications that expect a user with role test, and answer to a request on / and on /logout)

== Running the repro ==
- Go to http://localhost:8080/SingleSignOut/
- login: test/test
- Go to http://localhost:8080/SingleSignOut2/
- No login needed
- Go to http://localhost:8080/SingleSignOut2/logout

1)  Within server.xml, configure NIO http connector without an explicit linger setting:
    <Connector port=""8080"" protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol""
               connectionTimeout=""20000""
               redirectPort=""8443"" />


2)  Start Tomcat.  

Result: Linger is set to false for http nio connectors regardless of JVM default. 

Expected:  Linger parameter is not set on sockets.  JVM defaults are used.
Within setProperties method of SocketProperties.java,
breakpoint on line 194 should not be hit for http nio connector
socket.setSoLinger(soLingerOn.booleanValue(), soLingerTime.intValue()); 



Problem is that in the Http11NioProtocol constructor, a hard coded default value is set: 

    public Http11NioProtocol() {
        .... 
        setSoLinger(Constants.DEFAULT_CONNECTION_LINGER);  // -1
        ....  
    }

Any Java program can change the default socket factory for that JVM.  Tomcat cannot assume any particular default value for linger.  As per Tomcat's documentation, Tomcat should not be setting linger on the underlying socket unless it is specified within server.xml.

I suspect that this applies to other connectors as well e.g. AJP."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56416

EL expressions in jspx-files are Java-String-backslash-decoded twice when they're part of static template text. They're even decoded twice when they're part of certain JSP-Tag attributes, but they're only decoded once during processing when part of a JSTL tag attribute:

By looking into the source of Validator.java I observed that for the empty string we get the ELNode iterator but there isn't a check to see if the element has next node or not. The call ((ELNode.Text) el.iterator().next()).getText(); results in the above exception.
I added a test to see if the element has next node and it worked fine.
Attached is the patch for your reference.

    configurator = configuratorClazz.newInstance();

I don't understand why you don't like instantiating ClientEndpointConfig.Configurator class? This is an empty / default configurator for the endpoint which has a default constructor. Because of this bug I had do specify explicitly a dummy configurator e.g.:

import javax.websocket.ClientEndpointConfig;
public class CustomConfigurator extends ClientEndpointConfig.Configurator {
}

@ClientEndpoint(configurator = CustomConfigurator.class)
public class ClientEndpoint {

IMHO it's useless.

patch to docs/logging.xml

I decided to make a fresh start with my log4j configuration because it hasn't changed much since tc5. Naturally, I chose http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/logging.html as my starting point.

The sample configuration seems to suffer from the same kind of problem - log4j was quite picky about syntax in ""the old days"" and so the current version seemd to be worth a spring clean.

1. The File properties cause the ""live"" log files to be created with names that have a trailing dot. Further, as these files are renamed by the Rolling Appender they end up with a double dot in the middle of the new file name.

2. The ""live"" files also acquire an additional "".log"" suffix when Rolled. This is superfluous when the configuration quite sensibly puts all the files into a subdirectory called ""logs"".

3. Following log4j best practices (http://juliusdavies.ca/logging.html), I have extracted three error-prone substrings which are used many times, and defined them at the top of the configuration as local log4j symbolic variables.

4. I have consistently used white space around the property equals signs to improve readability. Some of the older properties did not use white space, while the newer ones did.

Web applications|Tomcat 7.0.54 (violetagg)|update|55383|Backport improved HTML markup for tables and code fragments from Tomcat 8 documentation. (kkolinko)|Improve markup and design of Tomcat's HTML pages|"Hi,

I think there is room for improvements in markup and style of Tomcat's HTML pages (e.g. to meet current HTML5 [1] standards and not using obsolete features) in Tomcat 8.
The ROOT index.jsp has alredy greatly been improved by pidster.

There are some other occurences of HTML in Tomcat's source that I think can be improved:
• Tomcat's error pages
• Examples webapp
• Probably also the Tomcat website (http://tomcat.apache.org/)


Some things that I think of being improvable are:

1) Use always ""Full Standards Mode"" instead of ""Quirks Mode"" or ""Almost Standards Mode"", as the Quirks mode is kind of a relict that browsers implement to be able to display Websites that were written for IE <= 5, which had serious layout errors. However, current Websites should always use Standards Mode as described in the HTML5 spec [1].
  This means that for HTML documents (""text/html""), always use the recommended doctype <!DOCTYPE html>. For XHTML documents (""application/xhtml+xml""), a doctype is not needed (as there is only Full Standards Mode), but should be used if making polyglot documents [2].
  Note: Placing a DOCTYPE after a HTML comment (like it is done at pidster's proposal here: http://people.apache.org/~pidster/tomcat/site/) will force IE 9 and older to use Quirks Mode; however, IE 10 and newer will use Full Standards Mode in such case. This can be tested by using IE's F12 developer tools.

2) Don't use obsolete HTML elements or attributes, like the ones which are replaced by CSS as they were purely used for styling and not markup (e.g. ""bgcolor"" or ""align"" attributes, <font> element etc.)

3) A <table> element should only be used for showing real tables, not for layouting purposes [3], like currently done at the Tomcat Website.

4) Use new HTML5 elements for structuring HTML content, like <nav> (marking a navigation section), <header>, <footer>; <time datetime=""...""> for marking a date with a machine-readable format and so on.
  HTML5 also allows to declare microdata in HTML markup using some new attributes like ""itemscope"", ""itemtype"" etc [9]. E.g. one can use microdata format provided by http://schema.org/ which should be recognized by Search Engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo and Yandex (but I don't know if this will be useful to the Tomcat website).
  However, if we still want to support IE versions older than IE9, then care must be taken when using new HTML elements, because IE <= 8 have a special parsing method of unknown elements compared to IE9 and other browsers. E.g., if you have 
  <myElement class=""myHeader"">Hi!</myElement>
  then the DOM in IE 9/10/11 and other browsers like Firefox represents exactly that piece of HTML, so if they don't know what a <myElement> element is, they will still use the CSS defined for class ""myHeader"" to format it. However in IE 8 and older, the DOM will look like 
  <myElement></myElement>Hi!</myElement><//myElement>
  (this is not valid HTML, but the DOM actually has a element with the name ""myElement"" and one with the name ""/myElement""), so it will not make use of the CSS defined for that element.  
  
5) Maybe also historical practices like putting CSS or Javascript into comments (""<style type=...><!-- .myClass {...} --></style>"") can be abandoned, as that was only required for very old browsers that did not know <style> or <script> elements, to prevent the content of such elements from appearing in a document as text. However, I cannot think of a still supported browser that would not recognize such elements.
  Note: For XHTML, this approach is actually wrong, because a XML parser will treat a comment inside of a style element like a comment, which means that the browser only sees a empty style element. There are ways to make things work if the document should be both a HTML and a XHTML document [4], but I don't think it makes sense (see 7) ).

6) Encodings can be set on HTML pages using <meta charset=""UTF-8"">, alternatively to <meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" value=""text/html; encoding=""UTF-8"">. I think the shorter form makes more sense because the Content-Type can only be set externally (by a Header or using a file extension) before a browser begins with parsing the document. It seems that even IE7 supports the short variant.
  Notice that this is for HTML only; for XHTML, the encoding can specified in the XML header declaration (<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>).
  Note: For the sake of polyglot documents (see 7) ), it is allowed that a XHTML document also includes a <meta charset=""UTF-8"" /> - but ""UTF-8"" is the only permitted value in this case [8]. Then, also a XML declaration may not be used as it is forbidden in HTML - this means a XML parser will determine the encoding from BOM bytes, if present - if not, UTF-8 will be used [7].
  Note: Even if the encoding is already set by a Content-Type header, I think it is a good practice to also include the encoding declaration in the document itself (of course, matching the one set in the Content-Type header).

7) Some HTML pages contain elements in a XHTML-compatible syntax, e.g. self-closing elements like ""<br />"", whereas others contain ""<br>"". Actually, when using ""<br />"" in a document that is sent using ""text/html"" (or a "".html"" file extension), this was wrong syntax according to previous HTML specifications, as only ""<br>"" syntax was allowed (even if a DOCTYPE states ""XHTML 1.0"", the browser actually uses a HTML parser instead of a XML parser when the page is sent with ""text/html"" instead of ""application/xhtml+xml""). However, the new HTML5 specification allows this syntax (<br />) in HTML documents.
  However, when a document is intended to be a polyglot document (i.e. a document that is compatible with both HTML and XML parsing modes), then there are a lot of other concerns that one needs to take care of, e.g. not to use entity references like ""&nbsp;"" as XML parsers are not guaranteed to process a external DTD (which would declare such entities), and also the HTML5 spec does not define any such DTD [5]. Furthermore, always write <input type=""checkbox"" checked=""checked"" itemscope=""itemscope"" /> instead of <input type=checkbox checked itemscope> and so on.
  However, I think it is easier to write documents that are either HTML only, or XHTML (XML) only. IE 9 is the first IE that supports XHTML, so I think, currently, a XHTML-only document is not an option here (whereas I do XHTML-only documents for my own websites, as I use a XML tool to generate the output and I don't care about IE <= 8). In this case, I think it is easier to use HTML-only syntax instead of creating a polyglot document.
  Actually, for a person that writes HTML by hand, I think it is easier to write HTML-only syntax; whereas for documents generated programatically by an XML writer, the XHTML-only syntax would fit better.
  

Please add, if I forgot something.


Now, if one is going to improve the markup of a document, I think it is a good idea to also improve the design/layout.

When I have time (and if you agree) I can start working on the things mentioned above, unless it is already done by another person ;-)

I see in the archives that Pidster already proposed a new layout for the Tomcat website [6] (which was the same layout as the ROOT index.jsp), which has not been accepted yet. I don't have another proposal for a new design of the Tomcat website atm, but I think the HTML markup can be improved (the points mentioned above) and the style can be tweaked a bit so that the site doesn't look dated.

What do you think?

This only happends sometimes, and is hard to reproduce.

After undeploying and deploying a webapp, sometimes the webapp show an exception at the jps's. 

I've traced it down to ManagerBase.java - generateSessionId() method. It looks like the sessionIdGenerator is null.

This was observed for Web Applications that
1. use Servlet 2.5 or earlier schemas/dtds in their web.xml file.
2. and have a Filter configured.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Put Tomcat 7.0.52 into ""scrict servlet compliance"" mode by adding the following line to conf/catalina.properties:

[[[
org.apache.catalina.STRICT_SERVLET_COMPLIANCE=true
]]]

2. Replace webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml with the following text
(It is web.xml from Tomcat 6 ROOT app  plus a added a <filter>):

3. Start Tomcat and access a JSP page:

The cause is that MergedWebXml that is used to pass configuration from Tomcat (Catalina) to JSP Engine (Jasper) was generated incorrectly for the specified version.

The XML text generated for a filter had  <async-supported>false</async-supported>, but such option is available for filters only starting with Servlet 3.0


Notes:
1. The generated XML can be logged with <Context logEffectiveWebXml=""true"" />
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/context.html

2. Tomcat 6 and 8 are not affected.
Tomcat 6 does not have web.xml merging, as support for web fragments is in Servlet 3.0 and later.
Tomcat 8 uses different mechanism to pass configuration to Jasper.

However, when using the ant tasks that come with TCD (and I suspect when using the Tomcat manager, although I have not tested that), it appears that the webapp is deleted and then uploaded (as opposed to just being replaced), which is causing the customized context.xml file to be lost and replaced with a default version.

=== Reply from Mark Thomas ===

Hmm. It looks like the update command does an undeployment followed by a
deploy rather than a replacement of the WAR file and a redeploy. You
aren't going to be able to fix that without code changes to Tomcat.

This extends the original fix for the APR/native output buffer to the NIO connector. (kkolinko)|java.nio.BufferOverflowException in AjpAprProcessor.output() when AJP client disconnects|"As reported on the users list [2] (note that I used Tomcat 7.0.27, but Bugzilla seems to have only 7.0.26):

Hi all,

some time ago, I wrote about a BufferOverflowException which I got sporadically on my Tomcat 7.0.21 [1], when using the AJP-APR-Connector.
However, at that time I couldn't reproduce the exception.

When I looked at this again today, I was able to create a client that sends an AJP message and aborts the connection, resulting in the BufferOverflowException in Tomcat. I was using Tomcat 7.0.27 with Tomcat Native 1.1.23, on Oracle JDK 1.7.0_03 and Windows 7 32-bit.


To reproduce,

1. On the server side, create a web application containing a servlet which will generate some random data:

@WebServlet(""/index.html"")
public class MyTestServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
       
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        try {
            response.setContentType(""text/plain"");
            response.setCharacterEncoding(""utf-8"");
            
            byte[] bytesToWrite = {48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57};
            
            // Try to write 1,000,000 bytes to the client.
            try (OutputStream out = response.getOutputStream()) {
                for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
                    out.write(bytesToWrite);
                }
            }
            
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            // Ignore
        }
    }
}

Deploy the application as ROOT, so that the servlet will be reachable at ""/"".
Configure Tomcat to have an AJP-APR connector listening on port 8009.


2. On the client side, create a program like this:

public class AjpTester {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        byte[] ajpPacketBytes = { // JK_AJP13_FORWARD_REQUEST for ""/""
            0x12, 0x34, 0x00, 0x54, 0x02, 0x02, 0x00, 0x08,

            0x2e, 0x32, 0x2e, 0x33, 0x2e, 0x34, 0x00, 0x00,
            0x07, 0x31, 0x2e, 0x32, 0x2e, 0x33, 0x2e, 0x34,
            0x00, 0x00, 0x09, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x61, 0x6c,
            0x68, 0x6f, 0x73, 0x74, 0x00, 0x00, 0x50, 0x00,
            0x00, 0x02, (byte)0xa0, 0x06, 0x00, 0x0a, 0x4b, 0x65,
            0x65, 0x70, 0x2d, 0x41, 0x6c, 0x69, 0x76, 0x65,
            0x00, (byte)0xa0, 0x0b, 0x00, 0x09, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x63,
            0x61, 0x6c, 0x68, 0x6f, 0x73, 0x74, 0x00, (byte)0xff
        };

        Socket s = new Socket(""localhost"", 8009); // connect to AJP port
        OutputStream sout = s.getOutputStream();
        InputStream sin = s.getInputStream();

        sout.write(ajpPacketBytes); // request Url ""/""

        // Read between 10,000 and 11,023 bytes, then exit the JVM
        byte[] buf = new byte[1024];
        int read;
        int bytesRead = 0;
        while ((read = sin.read(buf)) > 0) {
            bytesRead += read;
            if (bytesRead >= 10000) {
                System.exit(1);
            }
        }
    }
}

The client will send an JK_AJP13_FORWARD_REQUEST message which requests URL ""/"" and sends ""Connection: keep-alive"" and ""Host: localhost"" headers.


3. Tomcat will display this exception:

I guess the exception itself is harmless, but it may fill up log files, if clients disconnect frequently while receiving data.
Note that before that exception occurs, a regular ""ClientAbortException:  java.io.IOException: Failed to send AJP message"" is thrown by org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.realWriteBytes(OutputBuffer.java:388).
The exception occurs neither with AJP-BIO nor with AJP-NIO.

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.53 (violetagg)|fix|56172|Avoid possible request corruption when using the AJP NIO connector and a request is sent using more than one AJP message. Patch provided by Amund Elstad. (markt)|AjpNioProtocol sometimes corrupts (ignores) the request body|"Tomcat sometimes fails to read the request body when using the AjpNioProtocol 
connector. The symptom of this is the log message

ERROR org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpMessage - Invalid message received with 
signature  ...

The cause of this problem is the fact that the read-method in  AjpNioProcessor may read more than the requested number of bytes, if more than one readSocket call is required.

Thus, reading of an ajp-message can also wrongly read some or all of the next message(s) (if any). Reading of the next messages will then most likely fail with a signature error, or the content will be corrupt.

This problem is unlikely to happen unless the FORWARD_REQUEST message is larger than a network packet, and there is a request body with Content-Length > 0, so that first body chunk message immediately follows the FORWARD_REQUEST message.

I have reproduced and solved this problem with Tomcat 7.0.42, but looking at the source code I believe the problem should be present in trunk as well.

Description of patch to fix the problem:

The read-method may have to make several calls to readSocket to read the
requested number of bytes. Alter the maximum bytes read per call so that 
the total bytes read is never more than requested.

Looking into this, it appears that the EL is having trouble because StringBuilder's append method is overloaded.  It is instructed to call append with the character 'c', but instead is trying to coerce the character 'c' to a long and call append with the long.

This chain of events seems to be kicked off in AstValue.getValue() line #157, where it's calling resolver.invoke(..).  The call to resolver.invoke() is passing null as the paramTypes argument.  This trickles down to BeanELResolver.invoke(), which calls Util.findMethod().  Because paramTypes is null, Util.findMethod() selects the first method it finds with the expected number of arguments.  In the case above, it selects StringBuilder.append(long), which causes the problem above.



2.) Here's the second test.

   @Test

Looking into this error, it seems similar to #1.  The difference is that AstFunction.getValue() line #138 is calling invoke on the resolver and passing null as the paramTypes.  This trickles down to the StaticFieldELResolver.invoke() method, which calls Util.findConstructor().  Again, because paramTypes is null, Util.findConstructor() searches the available constructors for the one with the same number of arguments.  The reason that this intermittently fails is because on my system, the call to Class.getConstructors() returns the list of constructs in an arbitrary order. So it fails when Date(String) is listed first, but succeeds when Date(long) is listed first."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55483

As of now ""validateXml"" option is removed from Tomcat 8 since 8.0.3 onwards. Some pending cleanup and discussion on whether to reimplement in Tomcat 8 is tracked as bug 56199.


If you are using validateXml=""false"", my recommendation is to just remove that attribute from your build files. (It does not serve anything, as ""false"" is the default value for this attribute).

(markt)|ServletContext#setInitParameter(..) does not throw IllegalStateException after it's been initialized|"Created attachment 31369 [details]
.war with single Servlet

The Java EE javadoc for ServletContext#setInitParameter(String, String), here: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html#setInitParameter(java.lang.String, java.lang.String), states that the method should throw an IllegalStateException if the ServletContext has already been initialized.

Once a Servlet is ready to handle requests, the ServletContext must have been initialized. However, no exception is thrown if you try to invoke the method in an HttpServlet's doGet(..).

Steps to reproduce:

1) Add an HttpServlet that invokes the method in its doGet(..) method

@WebServlet(urlPatterns = ""/init"")
public class InitParameterServlet extends HttpServlet {
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
			throws ServletException, IOException {

		ServletContext context = getServletContext();
		context.setInitParameter(""init-param"", ""value"");

	}
}

2) Send an HTTP GET request to (the appropriate) 'http://localhost:8080/context/init`.

Actual results: No exception is thrown. Server sends back 200 OK.

Expected results: An exception should have been thrown. Server should have sent back 500 status code.

Hi,
I have several custom jspx tags with dynamic attributes that worked well up to Tomcat 7.0.47, but they do not work properly on Tomcat 7.0.52. Same problems occur also when using Spring form tags (I suspect that other libraries would have same problem, but I didn't test them).

sample (data-test[2] is dynamic attribute, onclick is static):
<c:set var=""world"" value=""'World'""></c:set>
<sf:form onclick=""window.alert('Hello ${world}!')""
        data-test=""window.alert('Hello ${world}!')""
        data-test2=""window.alert('Hello World!')""
tomcat 7.0.47 output:
<form onclick=""window.alert(&#39;Hello &#39;World&#39;!&#39;)""
        data-test=""window.alert(&#39;Hello &#39;World&#39;!&#39;)""
        data-test2=""window.alert(&#39;Hello World!&#39;)""
tomcat 7.0.52 output:
<form onclick=""window.alert(&#39;Hello &#39;World&#39;!&#39;)""
        data-test=""window.alert(&amp;#039;Hello &#39;World&#39;!&amp;#039;)""
        data-test2=""window.alert(&#39;Hello World!&#39;)""

If there is EL used in dynamic attribute (data-test), non-EL part of that attribute is escaped twice, EL part is escaped only once. Tomcat 7.0.47 would escape everything just once.
Everything works as before if static attribute is used (onclick) or there is no EL in dynamic attribute (data-test2).

[/quote]



If you forget to launch cmd.exe in that mode and just run ""service.bat install"",  with the current Tomcat versions (6.0.39, 7.0.50, 8.0.3) you will be prompted 3 times by UAC [3], but the service will be installed incorrectly.

With r1565781 / r1567742 (7.0.52) this was improved and you will be prompted by UAC only once, but still the service will be installed incorrectly.


The cause for this behaviour is that install command in service.bat script uses environment variables (such as PR_CLASSPATH) to pass parameters to service installer (prunsrv).[1] Apparently, when a child application is launched with elevated privileges it does not inherit environment variables from its parent. [2]

The consequence is that a number of crucial settings in the installed service will be blank. For example, its classpath and its log path will be blank.

As a result, an attempt to launch such service will fail shortly and silently, as Tomcat bootstrap classes are not found and logging is not configured either.

(There will be some logs in %SystemRoot%\system32\LogFiles\Apache  though).


A workaround is to fix such configuration by using service configuration application (tomcat7w.exe) to configure missing options.


I hope that this can be solved by changing service.bat so that all necessary options are passed as command-line arguments instead of variables.

Googling by the thread name, I found openjdk7 source code for sun.security.provider.SeedGenerator class at [1]

[1] http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/security/provider/SeedGenerator.java.html


To reproduce on an usual Tomcat instance, on Windows:
1). Create bin/setenv.bat:

set CATALINA_OPTS=-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom

2). Start Tomcat. Note what web application was deployed and started first. In my case it is ""docs"".

3). Trigger reload or redeploy of the web application (touch its WEB-INF/web.xml, or rename docs -> docs1).

After this, an ""appears to have started a thread named [SeedGenerator Thread]"" message is logged in catalina.<date>.log file.

(It does not matter whether the application actually generates session ids. It matters that it was the first to start session id generator).



My conclusion:
===============
1. This is triggered by the following setting in build.properties.default file:
test.jvmarg.egd=-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom

If the file ""/dev/urandom"" is not readable (e.g. on Windows, may be on some unix systems as well), SeedGenerator fallbacks to an algorithm that creates that ""SeedGenerator Thread"" thread.

2. Workaround:
Redefine this property in custom build.properties file.
Using any 1 of the following 2 lines works. The message disappears from test logs.

test.jvmarg.egd=-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom

test.jvmarg.egd=

(The ""file:/dev/urandom"" value is considered by SeedGenerator class as a special value, a marker to use native implementation of random seed generator).


Possible fixes:
================
1. Document this effect in places where ""java.security.egd"" property is mentioned.

A web application should not use such value of ""java.security.egd"" property when /dev/urandom is not readable.

(I know two places: Migration guide, ""FasterStartUp"" wiki page)

2. Fix configuration of the tests.

Maybe either document this in testing section of BUILDING.txt,
or move this property definition into build.xml, making it conditional on <available file=""/dev/urandom"">.

3. Can JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener guard against this?
Maybe it can, by creating a SecureRandom instance.

Generally, I see no need for such guard there, because trying to use /dev/urandom on a system where such file is not readable  is a blatant configuration error.


4. Can clearReferencesThreads turn a deaf ear to SeedGenerator thread?

I think it should not. I think it is a read issue that pins TCCL in memory."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56139

* After the auto-deploy fails, I can go into the HTML manager page and click the 'start' button, and the webapp does successfully start (tested the URL in the browser), but the WAR file still does not get unpacked into a directory.


Doing the exact same thing to a different server running Tomcat 6.0.24 works correctly as expected.

Any ideas here? Here is what I've ruled out so far:
* I don't think it's a file permission issue (tomcat7 is the owner of the webapps directory, and everything works fine when run through the manager HTML interface).
* The ""Child name '' is not unique"" sounded promising, but I could not find any duplicate ROOT webapps - there is no ROOT.war file or directory in the webapps directory prior to running the auto-deploy; there is no ROOT.xml file in the conf/Catalina/localhost directory, nor are there any context elements defined in the server.xml file.
* I don't think that the .war file is corrupt - I can manually unzip the .war file in the webapps from the command line using the 'unzip' command, and as I pointed out in #2 above, everything works fine when it is uploaded using the manager HTML interface.

This would be useful when using the embedded Tomact API to produce isolated servlet containers.  

I ran in to some difficulty with this when I was adding Tomcat support to the SBT (Simple Build Tool) plugin: https://github.com/JamesEarlDouglas/xsbt-web-plugin

In particular I had an issue where SBT includes a version of the Scala standard library, on the system classpath, that has been run through Proguard.  This  was conflicting with web applications that were including their own version of the Scala standard library.  I was eventually able to work around this using this hack: https://github.com/JamesEarlDouglas/xsbt-web-plugin/commit/f8a9b149f0c7c87d7b6e8f862c493841d82ad90a However, it would be nice if there was a way to accomplish this that didn't involve such a hack.

I would be happy to submit a patch for this.  However, I would like some guidence on how the API should be changed to accomplish this.  Perhaps a new flag on the WebappLoader class?

updated test class and new servlet test class

As the original author of this test class, I am embarrassed to have to open this bug report.

I started a code review and cleanup of this class some time ago, then tried to add some new test cases to examine the way the SSO Valve interacts with the standard Authenticators for a client that does not use cookies.

As my updated test class took shape, I started a thread on the users list called ""Single Signon without Cookies"". Based on this discussion, I removed a lot of my newly developed test cases because they were not needed. I was surprised because some of them completed ""successfully"" although I now realise they ought to have failed. After further investigation, I discovered that my original logic inadvertently allowed the client to return the SSO cookie even though instructed NOT to do so.

Once the tests were looking better, I decided to check the overall timing and found my new suite of 7 tests had an elapsed time of 290 seconds, while the current svn version completes in only 35 seconds. Long running times are unavoidable because two tests explore SSO and webapp session expiry.

One test case has to let a session expire and the shortest timeout is 1 minute. The other test has to let a session expire and prove that a longer-lived session preserves the SSO status. With an expiry granularity of 1 minute, the longer-lived session has to be expired after 2 more minutes. That means the test case will have run for nearly 4 minutes.

I do not understand why, in the svn (current) version, these two test cases always run to a successful completion. The remaining test cases do not expire sessions and all complete in less than 3 seconds, so the two expiry cases are waiting about 30 seconds between them. This simply isn't long enough.

What is worse, I noticed the setup methods for the two webapps call (Standard)Context.setSessionTimeout(int mins) with time arguments that are erroneously small numbers of seconds! The Tomcat code and documentation consistently define the session expiry argument to be a number of minutes, which means the short and long timeouts of 4 and 10 ""seconds"" would be interpreted as 4 and 10 MINUTES respectively, and so to work properly the current test ought to take about 20 minutes to complete, rather than the observed 35 seconds! I used a debugger to verify the two sessions have maxInactiveInterval set to 240 and 600 during one suspicious test.

I don't think it is productive to worry about the current versions of these tests, because I have significantly redeveloped the class and debugged it. The elapsed times of the test cases confirm they now work properly.

The new ""no cookies"" test case required a new variant of a test servlet which allows the client to supply a request parameter. This parameter is interpreted as a url which is to encoded and inserted into the HTML response. Thus the returned URL can be used by the client to continue using the established session.
   
The only downside was the increased elapsed time when compared to the broken version. Unfortunately, there is no simple way for a unit test to establish a shorter timeout than 60 seconds. This topic was discussed at length on the dev list - the most complete account is in Konstantin's post to ""Re: svn commit: r1415184"" on 4 December 2012.

The new version of the test class uses:
        ((ManagerBase) basicContext.getManager())
                .setProcessExpiresFrequency(MANAGER_EXPIRE_SESSIONS_FAST);
.. to ensure the sessions are expired as quickly as possible.

and:
        StandardSession.setMaxInactiveInterval(EXTRA_DELAY_SECS);
.. to force a quicker expiry of the session before waiting.

The new suite of tests complete in about 50 seconds, comparable to the old broken version, and only one quarter of the ""unkludged"" test time. Although the elapsed time could be trimmed a little bit more, I think the version I propose has a sensible resilience to variation in real-life timeouts.

The net result is an extensive change, but I cannot see how to implement it in smaller chunks because the changes are inter-dependent."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55960

Hi

SpnegoAuthenticator is not working with IBM JDK v7. The option GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME specified while generating ticket creates the following exception:-

major code: 11, minor code: 0
    major string: General failure, unspecified at GSSAPI level
    minor string: Desired initLifetime zero or less)

However specifying GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME as lifetime of credential resolves the issue. 

I am attaching a patch which optionally chooses cred lifetime as indefinite or default depending on whether the JDK is IBM JDK or Oracle/Sun JDK. This patch is with respect to SpnegoAuthenticator.java of tomcat v 7.0.50

Impact of fix:-

1. If not fixed then Tomcat does not work out of the box for Spnego Authentication(Kerberos) for IBM JDK v7

2. The fix affects only IBM JDK and does not change the execution flow for Oracle/Sun JDK

Patch for DigesterFactory.ifFor(...) method to relax assumptions related to class loading

This is perfectly fine for standalone Tomcat, of course. However, in our application we run embedded Tomcat in an isolated class loader, which includes all of Tomcat's jar files _except_ servlet-api.jar. servlet-api.jar is part of the class loader that is a  parent of the class loader for the embedded Tomcat.

The reason why the resource is not found is apparently that the class loader of ServletContext does not 'see' resources from jsp-api.jar.

We can work around that by placing jsp-api.jar into the same class loader that has servlet-api.jar, however this workaround is not ideal from our design perspective.

From the source of the idFor(...) method one could guess that the fallback attempt to find the requested resource in the javax.servlet.jsp.resources package is meant to look in jsp-api.jar. For that reason, would it be appropriate to perform the fallback lookup in the defining class loader of javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext? A patch file for the proposed fix is attached. If it is accepted please credit Juan Carlos Estibariz with it."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56016

JSR 356 is guilty for not specifying this order, but I believe a different order is more useful. 
Below I refer to ""the application"" as a subclass of the ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator implemented by end users.
I'd like to propose this new order:

modifyHandshake() as first: this allows applications to query/store information about the upgrade request (for example, the URI);

checkOrigin() as second: this allows applications to check the origin with more information available, because the request/response are available from the previous call and therefore checks of the origin against the request URI and/or other HTTP headers will be possible;

getNegotiatedSubprotocol() as third: this should be always invoked, while right now it is not invoked if the client does not specify the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header; this is not ideal since the server may have been configured with a sub-protocol, but the application is never called to check what the client has sent;

getEndPointInstance() as last: there is no point in creating the endpoint if the other methods returned a failure, nor there is point to invoke any other method if this one returned null.

The current order also does not invoke method getNegotiatedExtensions(), but as far as I understand extensions are not yet supported.
I believe this method should be eventually invoked as fourth, before getEndPointInstance().

Source to reproduce

In Tomcat, java.util.logging.LogManager.getLogManager() is in general an instance of org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager.

In a webapp, when iterating over the result of LogManager.getLogManager().getLoggerNames(), a ConcurrentModification can sometimes occur.

To reproduce :
- download attached test-1.0.zip
- run ""mvn clean package"" using Maven
- copy ""target/test-1.0.war"" into tomcat/webapps
- start Tomcat
- see a lot of ""Issue reproduced: java.util.ConcurrentModificationException"" in the System output

This webapp uses simple Logger.getLogger(String) and LogManager.getLoggerNames() in threads.
I my case, this is reproduced using Tomcat 7.0.42 and JDK 1.7. 

I suppose that a copy of the result could be made in org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager.getLoggerNames()"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56082

Servlet with Async processing and Java Based client

I created a ProblemServlet which receives request via a Java based client. The Servlet starts an Async processing for each request.
Within the Async processing run() method there is a while loop which cyclically sends String messages to the client. The implementation of run method is shown.

public void run()
        {
            try
            {
                String msg = """";

                while (continu)
                {
                    msg = """";

                    msg = ""|"" + "" "" + new Date();
                    System.out.println(""publishing message... "" + msg);
                    
                    outputStream.println(msg);
                    publisherAsyncCtx.getResponse().flushBuffer();
                    
                    try
                    {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    }
                    catch (InterruptedException e)
                    {
                        System.out.println(""sleep InterruptedException: "" + e.getMessage());
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }

When a Java based console application client hits this servlet and reads its output stream, for around 10 sec the messages arrive. But after 10 seconds the connection is closed by the server.

But I got it working with a small code change in org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AbstractEndpoint.adjustRelativePath() method. When Windows-MY keystore is used there is no physical keystore file. To be able to pass in empty value for the keyStoreFile in the connector I added a check for not empty path before adjusting the path.

In our case, we do NOT use annotation, but we ""extend Endpoint"" and ""implement Whole<ThingworxMessage>"".  I was forcing a DecodeException to occur - expecting to my onError to be called with the actual DecodeException.  Instead, I got a Null.  

Stepping the following code in Tomcat:

in onMessage, the ((WsSession)session) is NULL.  As a result, the actual DecodeException (cause) is lost.

       // Can this message be decoded?
        Object payload;
        try {
            payload = decode(message);

                results.add(result);

(markt)|RemoteEndpoint.Async#sendText(String, SendHandler) can cause StackOverflowErrors and contradicts Oracle's JavaDoc|"See thread on users list [1]:

Tomcat's current implementation of RemoteEndpoint.Async#sendText(String, SendHandler) can cause StackOverflowErrors (and seems to contradict Oracle's JavaDoc).

In Tomcat, Async#sendText(...) seems to implemented so that when it could send all of the data immediately, then it directly calls SendHandler#onResult(...); whereas when it couldn't send the data immediately, the SendHandler will be called from another thread.

Oracle's javadoc for RemoteEndpoint.Async says:

""The completion handlers for the asynchronous methods are always called with a different thread from that which initiated the send.""

Now, imagine the case that you want to send 10000 very small text messages to a client (very unlikely, but possibly could happen). With synchronous I/O (RemoteEndpoint.Basic), you would do this in this way:

        RemoteEndpoint.Basic basic = session.getBasicRemote();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            basic.sendText(""Hi, Count: "" + i);
        }

In this case, there is no problem.

Now imagine you want to do this asynchronously (using a Callback to be informed when sending is completed), then you could do it this way (e.g. put the following code in onOpen() method of Tomcat's EchoEndpoint example):

        final AtomicInteger aint = new AtomicInteger();
        final RemoteEndpoint.Async async = session.getAsyncRemote();
        
        SendHandler handler = new SendHandler() {
            @Override
            public void onResult(SendResult result) {
                int nextVal = aint.incrementAndGet();
                if (nextVal < 10000) {
                    async.sendText(""Hi, Count: "" + nextVal, this);
                }
            }
        };
        async.sendText(""Hi, Count: "" + aint.get(), handler);

The problem here is that because the messages are very short, Tomcat will be able to send them immediately, calling the SendHandler#onResult() directly from Async.sendText(), which will eventually cause a StackOverflowError.

I think if SendHandler#onResult() was always called from a different thread than the one which calls Async.send... (like the Javadoc says), then although the performance would probably be worse, StackOverflowErrors shouldn't occur.

Patch provided by Arunav Sanyal. (markt)|Tomcat SPNEGO authenticator incompatible with IBM JDK in case of Keytab based initiate and accept authentication|"Hi

Our company has a use case in which our domain is a tomcat process. In our code, we support a parallel protocol which uses In memory based jaas configuration - 

public class OurLoginConfiguration extends Configuration

In IBM JDK 7, we need to initiate using keytab which needs the system property javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly to be set to true for it to work. However Tomcat sets it in  

Inside SpnegoAuthenticator:-

 protected void initInternal() throws LifecycleException {
        super.initInternal();

        // Kerberos configuration file location
        String krb5Conf = System.getProperty(Constants.KRB5_CONF_PROPERTY);
        if (krb5Conf == null) {
            // System property not set, use the Tomcat default
            File krb5ConfFile = new File(Bootstrap.getCatalinaBase(),
                    Constants.DEFAULT_KRB5_CONF);
            System.setProperty(Constants.KRB5_CONF_PROPERTY,
                    krb5ConfFile.getAbsolutePath());
        }

        // JAAS configuration file location
        String jaasConf = System.getProperty(Constants.JAAS_CONF_PROPERTY);
        if (jaasConf == null) {
            // System property not set, use the Tomcat default
            File jaasConfFile = new File(Bootstrap.getCatalinaBase(),
                    Constants.DEFAULT_JAAS_CONF);
            System.setProperty(Constants.JAAS_CONF_PROPERTY,
                    jaasConfFile.getAbsolutePath());
        }
        
        // This property must be false for SPNEGO to work
        System.setProperty(Constants.USE_SUBJECT_CREDS_ONLY_PROPERTY, ""false"");
    }

as false in the last line which causes havoc in the code. A multithreaded startup causes a breakdown in further authentication for keytab based logging.


Now a little more investigation revealed that tomcat acts only as an acceptor. Now this property need not necessarily be set to false for it to work(in both IBM and SUN JDK). 

Source of claim - http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~weijun/special/krb5winguide-2/raw_files/new/kwin

Excerpt:-
 2. Direct JGSS:

      /* JGSS-API calls... */

       In this case, the JAAS config file's entry name MUST be the
       standard entry name (com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.initiate), and you
       must set -Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly=false on the
       Java command line. Read
       [26]http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgs
       s/tutorials/BasicClientServer.html for details.
Which means only initiate based auth needs the system property.

This is also confirmed in IBM with a sample program.

Test case to reproduce request state (cookie) leakage

This issue is easily reproducible with the attached test case. Request state is leaked between requests due to the ADAPTER_NOTES note on the coyote request containing the catalina connector request (which holds the cookies from the first request) and never gets cleaned up in this error case (and maybe others similar to it).

It seems like it would be worthwhile to clear out the notes field from the coyote request when we recycle() it to prevent future issues like this."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55772

Test case (modifications to the Chat example)

Hi,

a thread on the Users List [1] described that problems can occur when sending large messages over a WebSocket connection using getBasicRemote().sendText(String).

The ChatAnnotation class does not synchronize when using this method, which means that multiple threads could call RemoteEndpoint.Basic#sendText() concurrently.

The JavaDoc of RemoteEndpoint.Basic says:

""If the websocket connection underlying this RemoteEndpoint is busy sending a message when a call is made to send another one, for example if two threads attempt to call a send method concurrently, or if a developer attempts to send a new message while in the middle of sending an existing one, the send method called while the connection is already busy may throw an IllegalStateException.""

(I thought I had read earlier that the implementation should synchronize calls to methods of RemoteEndpoint.Basic instead of throwing an ISE, but maybe that has changed).


When sending large Messages over Websocket using RemoteEndpoint.Basic from different threads without or with synchronization, some problems happen like:
a) The WebSocket connection is suddenly closed (I guess the browser
   actually aborts the connections due to data corruption or Timeout errors,
   but I have not examined the raw data sent over TCP)
b) Various Exceptions occur (see below)
c) Sometimes when I open the chat.xhtml example in my browser, it shows what
   seems to be a raw WebSocket response instead of the .xhtml file (see
   added screenshots)

These issues also happen after synchronizing calls to RemoteEndpoint.Basic#sendText(), but are then harder to reproduce.



To reproduce: 
1) Checkout Tomcat 8 trunk (r1543467) and apply the attached patch. It applies some modifications to the Chat Websocket Example, so that the Javascript sends messages in a regular interval (50 ms), and the ChatAnnotation modifies the message to be 256 times as large as the original message, and sends it back using session.getBasicRemote()#sendText(msg). 

2) Build Tomcat and run it on a Windows machine (I used Windows 8.1 x64, Java 1.7.0_45 x64), using the NIO HTTP connector (default configuration).

3) Open Firefox and IE 11. With both browsers, open the Chat example (http://localhost:8080/examples/websocket/chat.xhtml).

4) Repeat the following actions in a regular interval:
   a) Wait several seconds (it might be that Tomcat already closes one of
      the two WebSocket connections in that time).
   b) On one of the browsers (e.g. IE), press F5 several times.

5) After some time, you can see that in one of the browsers, the WebSocket connection is suddenly closed. Tomcat will show one or more of the following exceptions (I think the IOException and ClosedChannelException are expected if the browser aborts the connection):

If you try to press F5, then it might be that the Websocket connection is closed as soon as it was opened, or that the browser doesn't get a response for the request to chat.xhtml.



Now, add synchronization by modifying ChatAnnotation's broadcast() method:

    private static void broadcast(String msg) {
        for (ChatAnnotation client : connections) {
            synchronized (client) {
                try {
                    client.session.getBasicRemote().sendText(msg);
                } catch (Exception e) {
    
                }
            }
        }
    }

and repeat the above steps.

Now, if you open chat.xhtml with both IE and Firefox and do nothing, the WebSocket connection will not be closed. Even if you start to repeatedly press F5, most of the time everything will appear normal (besides getting IOExceptions and ClosedChannelExceptions).

However, after I tried this several minutes, I still got the problems that the WebSocket connections are closed just after opening it (or after some time), or that the browser didn't get a response to its HTTP request, or that the browser got a raw WebSocket reply instead of the XHTML page reply (see added screenshots).

I also got these exceptions:

Proposed patch

Currently the only available customisation is setting trust store via SSL_TRUSTSTORE_PROPERTY. This is not enough in situations where custom trust manager has to be used. The most trivial example I can think of is accepting all certificates.

My proposition is to use new property to pass SSLContext using user properties of ClientEndpointConfig.

(markt)|Do not parse web-fragment.xml files when empty absolute-ordering|"ContextConfig.webConfig() does the following:

1. Scans for web fragments
> Map<String,WebXml> fragments = processJarsForWebFragments();

This method
a) returns a list of all JAR files, not ignored by jarsToSkip options
b) parses ""META-INF/web-fragment.xml"" files when they are present

2. Filters and sorts them according to ordering
> orderedFragments = WebXml.orderWebFragments(webXml, fragments, sContext);

3. Uses the ordered set of fragments to look for SCI declarations

4. Uses the ordered set of fragments to
- scan them for annotated classes
- merge into main web.xml

5. Uses the original list of web fragments to scan for resources.

I am saying that parsing of the fragments (step 1-b)) can be skipped when the web application is configured with an empty ordered-fragments element and web.xml validation is turned off (strict servlet compliance is off).

Note that metadata-complete=true alone does not allow to skip that parsing, because we need fragment names to perform the ordering.

It seems that skipping that parsing when validation is on would be a bad idea. We are still using those JARs for resources and thus I think we should validate them."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55811

If I call 'response.setBufferSize(1,000,000);' and send about 20,000 characters, the response will be chunked even though it should not.
The response is sent in several chunks and contains the 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' response header.
In my understanding in this case the response should be fully buffered on the server and then sent as a whole containing the Content-Length-header.

This causes a problem in my application because I want to use a larger buffer to be able to redirect to an error page if an error occurs during rendering the response. 

I was able to reproduce this on Tomcat 7.0.39, 7.0.40, 7.0.42, 7.0.47. Tomcat 7.0.37 works fine and as expected.

This is easily reproducable by using a JSP as follows:

(markt)|Tomcat SPNEGO authenticator incompatible with IBM JDK: Accept Security Context needs to be wrapped around a Privileged Action in order for server side authentication|"Created attachment 31098 [details]
Contains GNU unified diff of SpnegoAuthenticator and its modified format

Hi

Problem report:-

In bug report 55760, a change was made in which system property javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly is no longer set to false. So it naturally follows that GSSAPI AcceptSecContext method is wrapped in a PrivilegedExceptionAction. It is found in IBM JDK that it fails otherwise.
 
Cause of failure:-

When IBM JDK tries to fetch credential in GSSAPI AcceptSecContext method, it does so from JAAS Subject. Since this call is not performed in Subject.doAs, the call fails as IBM JDK does not have access to a JAAS subject and cannot fetch a credential.
 
Please find attached:-

1. File containing gnu unified diff format of SpnegoAuthenticator with its modified version. PLEASE NOTE THIS DIFF IS ON TOP OF BUG FIX REPORTED IN 55760. This file now also contains AcceptAction class which wraps GSSAPI AcceptSecContext as a PrivilegedExceptionAction.

This fix solves the issue by allowing IBM JDK to fetch credential from JAAS Subject.

But, It is rendered completely wrongly as ***** IF text='&amp;foobar' *****
<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.alert(&quot;&amp;amp;foobar&quot;)"">foobar</a>

The EL expression ${text} should be rendered without any escape, but now it is
escaped just as other literal part in the attribute.

Generally, a tagx file's compiler must not make any assumption that it's output is a well-formed XML or not, it should just keep the literal atrribute or text as is, and output any EL expression directly. It's the tagx file's author's reponsibility to determine whether a text variable should be escaped, e.g.:
<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.alert(&quot;${fn:escape(text)}&quot;)"">foobar</a>

Suppose we have:
request.setAttribute(""text"", ""2 &gt; 1"");

When developing our web project locally we use an exploded war layout. The compile output
of web_base_jar is directly copied (not as a jar!) to the war’s
web_war/WEB-INF/classes directory by our ide’s (eclipse with sysdeo plugin and intellij).
Our shared taglib ends up here: web_war/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/myTaglib.tld. The taglib
is successfully picked up by the Jar Scanner configured with “scanAllDirectories”.

This leads to the following generated jsp code when myTaglib is used:

  static {

    _jspx_dependants.put(""file:/somepath/pc_web_war_exploded/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/ myTaglib.tld

The relevant code for this snippet is in org.apache.jasper.compiler.TagLibraryInfoImpl.<init>(TagLibraryInfoImpl.java:173).
Because the Taglib is a file uri (file:/C:/somepath/pc_web_war_exploded/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/myTaglib.tld)
it is not found by ApplicationContext#getResource and the method
org.apache.jasper.JspCompilationContext.getLastModified(JspCompilationContext.java:437) returns
-1 in this case.

When the compiler checks if the current jsp is outdated it checks also all includes/dependants.
Because myTaglib is in the dependants  list of our jsps it is also checked. The check tests
the lastModified timestamp of the file against -1 and returns always true. See here org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler.isOutDated(Compiler.java:519)

In this page of the Tomcat 7 documentation - but this is true for all versions - there is the following statement:

""The resource factory will create a new instance of the appropriate bean class every time a lookup() for this entry is made.""

But that seems not true. I created an example foo.bar.Bean, which simply increment a static int at each creation. Then, I configured a BeanFactory in the global resources section of server.xml, and I deployed a servlet which simply lookup 1000 thousand times for the bean and print its string representation in the response. 

To reproduce, follow the steps below using the targz attached:

1) configure a resource with a BeanFactory, as in the server.xml attached;
2) put the bean-factory-bug-bean.jar in the common classpath of the container;
3) start the container;
4) deploy the bean-factory-bug-web.war file in the appbase folder;
5) open http://localhost:8080/bean-factory-bug-web/BeanServlet

As for one can read from the documentation, the expected output is 

Bean #1
Bean #2
Bean #3
...
Bean #999
Bean #1000

But the actual output is

Bean #1
Bean #1
Bean #1
...
Bean #1
Bean #1

I think that the actual behaviour of the container is the most advisable behaviour, but would be better to update the documentation to match it and avoid misleading.

the patch, based on revision 1213685

Cobertura (cobertura.sf.net) is an opensource Java code coverage tool released (with in dependencies) under The Apache Software License, Version 1.1 and/or The GNU General Public License, Version 2.0.

It can assess how much of the codebase was actually executed during a program run.
If the program run means running the test suite, it will produce results showing how much of the code the tests cover, potentially discover weak spots.

This patch provides support for Cobertura in the build.xml and build.properties.default files. It introduces four new targets:
 * download-cobertura - downloads and unpacks Cobertura in ${base.path}
 * cobertura-enable - enables Cobertura to be used
 * cobertura-instrument - adds Cobertura instrumentation to compiled bytecode
 * cobertura-report - produces reports from Cobertura results. HTML by default
   (can be overwritten with 'cobertura.report.format' property).

The behavior of this patch doesn't break existing targets in any way.

To use this tool, one simply runs 'ant cobertura-enable test' which will instrument the compiled classes before running the tests and also supply all the necessary resources for Cobertura to gather the coverage results.
Once the tests are completed 'ant cobertura-report' will produce lovely HTML report about the test coverage in '${tomcat.build}/coverage'.

NOTE: Although the result of the test cases should not be affected by Cobertura, it is not guaranteed."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52323

It has side effects when starting a new Server as some Tomcat components like MapperListener components rely on what they find in the MBeanServer and try to work with objects that don't exist anymore (like Host for MapperListener)

Provided unit test shows a part of the problem (in fact the helper class Tomcat should be improved to register all MBeans just like a ""normal"" Tomcat distribution).

A workaround consists in cleaning up the JMX tree from all Catalina objects once server.stop() has been called.

For info: it seems that such a problem has already been reported: bug #47046"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49134

Patch to add the Drawboard example

Hi,

I would like to add this Drawboard example to Tomcat's Websocket examples.

It is a page where you can draw with your mouse or touch input (using different colors) and everybody else which has the page open will immediately see what you are drawing.
If someone opens the page later, they will get the current room image (so they can see what was already drawn by other people).

It uses asynchronous sending of messages so that it doesn't need separate threads for each client to send messages (this needs NIO or APR connector to be used).
A ""Room"" (where the drawing happens) has a dedicated thread because the actions which are done in one Room are single-threaded (like drawing to a BufferedImage). If multiple rooms were used, then each Room would have its own dedicated thread (but currently only one Room is implemented).

When you open the page, first you will receive a binary websocket message containing the current room image as PNG image. After that, you will receive string messages that contain the drawing actions (line from x1,y1 to x2,y2).
Note that it currently only uses simple string messages instead of JSON because I did not want to introduce a dependency on a JSON lib.

It uses synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the final image will look the same for every user, regardless of what their network latency/speed is - e.g. if two user draw at the same time on the same place, the server will decide which line was the first one, and that will be reflected on every client.

What do you think?"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55639
Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.45 (violetagg)|add|55576|Preserve the order in which request parameters were received when accessing them via the Servlet API. (markt)|Order of ServletRequest parameters is not preserved|"The ServletRequest interface provides two methods to iterate through request parameters:

Enumeration<String> getParameterNames(), and
Map<String, String[]> getParameterMap()

Unfortunately, the underlying implementation in Tomcat is a HashMap, which fails to preserve the order of parameters as they are specified in the request.

An alternate implementation should be used to preserve request order.  LinkedHashMap, for example, is capable of preserving insertion order.

The Servlet Specification (v3.0) speaks only to the relative ordering of query string data and post body data. However, section 17.13.3 of the HTML specification (v4.01) titled ""Processing form data"", clearly states that ""control names/values are listed in the order they appear in the document.""

Therefore, I do not see a valid interpretation of either specification to rationalize Tomcat's implementation. To receive a request with an ordered list of parameters and represent them in an implementation that is guaranteed not to preserve this order is difficult to rationalize."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55576

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.43 (violetagg)|fix|55230|Use the correct resource path when obtaining an InputStream for resources served by a ProxyDirContext. (markt)|DirContextURLConnection.getInputStream() fails to reopen resources for ProxyDirContext|"There appears to be a bug in the DirContextURLConnection where it fails to reopen the resource in the getInputStream method when its context is a ProxyDirContext.

The DirContextURLConnection's connect method has some special case code for the ProxyDirContext where it's stripping the hostName and the contextPath off of the path given by the URL, and then using that stripped path in its context.lookup call. This part works great.

However, in the getInputStream method the DirContextURLConnection attempts to reopen the resource without doing this special case logic on the path used in the context lookup. It tries to look up the resource with the raw path from the URL object, which fails. A NamingException is thrown, which is swallowed, and the potentially stale resource from the initial call to connect is returned instead.


In my application this isn't causing a logic issue because the resources I'm looking up aren't changing between the initial connection and the first call to getInputStream, but this bug is manifesting as a notable performance problem. Every time a bad path is passed into the ProxyDirContext it's actually causing quite a lot of NamingExceptions to be thrown as it tries alternative paths (see BaseDirContext.lookup). All of these exceptions are swallowed but what I'm seeing is that this is happening many times over the course of a request as my application is looking up different resources, and the time it takes to build all of these swallowed NamingExceptions has become significant."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55230

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.43 (violetagg)|fix|55354|Ensure that the naming context environment parameters are restored after associating the Principle with the user name. Based on patch provided by Richard Begg. (violetagg)|JNDIRealm.getPrincipal(context,username,gssCredential) corrupts realm context|"The getPrincipal(context,username,gssCredential) method in JNDIRealm is designed to allow delegated credentials to be applied to the directory server connection as part of SPNEGO authentication.

This is done by manipulation of a number of the directory context's environment parameters.

However, as currently implemented, these environment parameters are forcibly cleared after the getUser() call regardless of whether the values were even changed (i.e. if isUseDelegatedCredential() returned false).

If the container realm is defined to use GSSAPI authentication, only the first SPNEGO authentication request will succeed.  All subsequent requests will fail with this exception:
javax.naming.NamingException: [LDAP: error code 1 - 000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C0906DC, comment: In order to perform this operation a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, v1db0 

The exception is due to the Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION being cleared by getPrincipal() - resulting in a attempted ""simple"" bind with no username/password (i.e. anonymous).

A workaround is to ensure that the connectionName and connectionPassword parameters are specified in the realm definition - however, if one is using GSSAPI - this shouldn't be necessary and certainly defeats the purpose of using GSSAPI in the first place.

The code should preserve pre-existing environment parameters in the context before changing them, then restore those values afterwards - rather than just clearing the settings completely."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55354

But in my webapplication, there is an object in my session which is an instance of org.apache.el.MethodExpressionImpl. This class implements the Externalizable interface but in this readExternal method it uses org.apache.el.util.ReflectionUtil.forName(String) which use Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() as its ClassLoader.

It seems to be incorrect because this method return a StandardClassLoader which cannot find my classes in WEB-INF/lib directory of my webapp.

Is it the problem of the MethodExpressionImpl class which use this method or the JDBCStore which does not set the thread contextClassLoader as the WebappClassLoader ?

(markt)|Race Condition in HttpSession#invalidate() / HttpServletRequest#getSession(boolean)|"Created attachment 30798 [details]
code flow that exhibits the race condition

For session fixation protection, we have to discard a user's session and create a new one whenever the user's login state changes. For this we rely on Spring Security's SessionFixationProtectionStrategy that, at its core, uses the following commands:

  session.invalidate();
  session = request.getSession(true);

Yesterday, we had a message in the log that indicates the latter command returned the same session that was invalidated in the line before:
""Your servlet container did not change the session ID when a new session was created. You will not be adequately protected against session-fixation attacks (catalina-exec-339, org.springframework.security.web.authentication.session.SessionFixationProtectionStrategy, SessionFixationProtectionStrategy.java:102)""

When I investigated this issue, I found there is in fact a race condition if two threads (associated with requests from the same client) enter the session fixation protection code in parallel. I attached a TXT file that illustrates the code flow that leads to the race condition: When thread B calls session.invalidate(), the call returns immediately becuase the session is already in the ""expiring"" state. Since the session is not invalid yet, the call to request.getSession(true) won't create a new session, though. So in effect, thread B cannot obtain a new session.

The documentation at http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/servletapi/ has no indication that a session may not yet be invalid when session.invalidate() returns. The session interface neither provides a way to detect ""expiring"" session.

The error message appears only once in the production log files that go some weeks back, so it seems to be an infrequent event. Nevertheless, it should be possible to implement session fixation without a race condition.

War demonstrating the issue

Quote entity in html element attribute evaluated in tagx if attribute contains EL expression 

If your tagx file contains an html element such as
<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)"">foobar</a>
It renders as
<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)"">foobar</a>

If your tagx file contains an html element such as
<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.alert(&quot;${text}!&quot;)"">foobar</a>
It renders as (if text='foobar')
<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.alert(""foobar"")"">foobar</a>
Most browsers aren't too happy with this.

I would have expected this to render as
<a href=""#"" onclick=""window.alert(&quot;foobar&quot;)"">foobar</a>
I browsed through jsp 2.1 spec and couldn't identify anything that explicitly covered this, but I would expect valid xml output from a tagx file.

You don't see this behaviour if you use a tag file. We need to use tagx files to work around various problems in WebSphere and WebLogic containers.

A test war is attached. It is setup for servlet spec 2.5 and jsp 2.1 --- I am actually using a Tomcat 6 container, but thought I'd test this on the latest release.

Patch to resolve issue

As long as you correctly structure your JARs and call setParentClassLoader() with the current thread class loader on the Engine, Host, Server and Service, you can run Embedded Tomcat using Java Web Start. It's actually pretty neat.

The only problem is that JarScanning doesn't work. In Java Web Start, all JAR URLs obtained from the class loader are the full http(s) URLs from where they were downloaded. Java has them cached locally, so accessing them is just as efficient because they're really coming from the local file system. However, the StandardJarScanner ignores JAR URLs that don't start with ""file:"" or ""jndi:"".

Regular Expressions in SSI fail to parse.

This uses SSI in 7.0.39 using SSIFilter.  The file is parsed, in principle, but whenever an IF expression with a certain regular expression is encountered, Tomcat seems to either show an exception (test case 2) stop processing the file and will not return any contents after that (for test case 3).

Certain very simple regular expressions such as /a/ do not show an error (test case 1).


Example:

My request is:

http://...:8080/tomcat7_ssi_bug/foo.html?year=234234

The relevant portion of the file is (test case 3):

<!--#if expr=""${QUERY_STRING} = /year=(.*)/"" -->
   
I have tried a number of variants, including $QUERY_STRING instead of ${...}.
I find no error about this in the logs.

I tried simpler regular expressions.  The following

<!--#if expr=""${QUERY_STRING} = /year=/"" -->

Leads to the error below:

java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.catalina.ssi.ExpressionParseTree$EqualNode cannot be cast to org.apache.catalina.ssi.ExpressionParseTree$StringNode

This occurs whenever the regular expression does not contain any parenthesis.  

Attached war file contains foo.html, showing test cases 1 and 2, and bar.html, showing test case 1 and 3.

I looked at the code briefly and noticed the use of a SelectionKey Iterator.  I have not dug deep enough to find any issue in the NioReceiver code, but I did find this potentially relevant text in the Selector javadocs (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/Selector.html):

""A selector's key and selected-key sets are not, in general, safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If such a thread might modify one of these sets directly then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set itself. The iterators returned by these sets' iterator methods are fail-fast: If the set is modified after the iterator is created, in any way except by invoking the iterator's own remove method, then a ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown."""|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54086

Patch for changes to catalina.sh to wait till process dies completely

In Tomcat 7, when the container is stopped using catalina.sh stop force, the catalina.sh script uses the CATALINA_PID environment variable to send a kill -9 to the pid of the currently running container process. However, this doesn't kill the process instantaneously - say for e.g. when the process is in the middle of a system call or is in the UNINTERRUPTIBLE state. In this case, why cant we use the kill -0 ``cat ""$CATALINA_PID""`` >/dev/null 2>&1 trick of checking the liveness of the process before removing the PID file that is used with stop in the non-force mode? This would ensure that the stop force is somewhat synchronous. Just wanted to know if there are good reasons why this was not done. If we don't see any issue with this, I am attaching a patch (to catalina.sh) that is intended to do this. Let me know if there are any questions.

(markt)|Change Javadoc generation per CVE-2013-1571, VU#225657|"Oracle has announced a Javadoc vulnerability (CVE-2013-1571 [1], VU#225657 [2]) whereby Javadoc generated with Java 5, Java 6, or Java 7 < 7u25 is vulnerable to a frame injection attack. Oracle has provided a repair-in-place tool for Javadoc that cannot be easily regenerated, but is urging developers to regenerate whatever Javadoc they can using Java 7u25. For all practical purses, the vulnerability really only applies to publicly-hosted Javadoc, so the Javadoc in our existing Maven artifacts, downloads, and archived downloads really doesn't have to be worried about (not that we could do anything about it). My thoughts on this:

1) We should apply the repair-in-place tool ASAP to the Javadoc on the website for Tomcat 6 and Tomcat 7.

2) Future Tomcat 6 and 7 Javadoc should be generated with 7u25 or better. There will be no fix for Java 5 or 6. Thankfully, generating Javadoc using a different JDK than you used to compile is quite easy in both Maven and Ant. In fact, I personally prefer it that way, because the Javadoc is much more visually attractive in Java 7.

I will file an issue about this two, but I wanted to go ahead and make the list aware.

When this limit is hit Tomcat returns a HTTP 400 response with a blank page and in the default configuration nothing is logged by the server. The org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpProcessor class logs the error at DEBUG level but that doesn't get written anywhere using the default configuration.

The use case for more than 100 headers is the use of SSO systems that provide user attributes via HTTP headers. The Internet2 Shibboleth project is one good example, it is quite common to have well over 100 headers getting passed to Tomcat when using these systems.

I'd like to propose one of the following fixes:

- Write a message to the response explaining why the 400 response was returned. This would make it much easier for application deployers to determine the cause of the non-functional application.

- Have a default logger setup for the AJP connector and change the log level to INFO. Perhaps this gets treated as a one time warning and the first request that hits this limit is logged as WARN and the subsequent requests are logged at DEBUG to avoid log clutter.

- Increase the default value of maxHeaderCount to 1000 which would more easily accommodate the use of HTTP headers to pass user attributes.

A patch file containing CORS filter source code, units tests, and changes to tomcat documentation's filter.xml.

CORS Filter implementation

This is an enhancement request to include CORS Filter as one of Tomcat's container provided filters.

CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is a W3C specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) that defines a mechanism to enable cross origin requests. This is a Java Servlet Filter implementation of server-side CORS.

Here are few reasons that makes this implementation is a good fit:
* Implements all required sections of the spec for servers. Handles simple/actual and pre-flight requests as per the specification.
* Written specifically to fit well with Tomcat's source, and is formatted the same as Tomcat's source.
* Filter implementation is just one class and is well Javadoc'd
* Includes ample unit tests to validate the implementation against the spec
* Simple to configure minimally and use
* Easy to override default configuration, if required
* Protects against CRLF injection / response splitting attacks.

We(eBay) would like to contribute this implementation to Apache Software
Foundation, to be included in Tomcat 8. And, I would also like to maintain and develop it, going forward. 

It's true that as a Servlet Filter, any webapp developer may add it to their app whether Tomcat includes it or not, but we believe that this is fundamental server behavior that should be present and easy to enable in the server, as it is in some other servers."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55046

[quote]
I would like to have a section explaining how to use SimpleFormatter.format, because I can't make log behave as expected when using JULI. Seems that Tomcat always ignore my attemps - unless I set in catalina.sh the system property: -Djava.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=""[%1$tY-%1$tm-%1$td %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS.%1$tL] %4$s: %5$s %6$s %n"" Would this be clarified in documentation?
[/quote]

I am confirming this behaviour with with the current Tomcat 7.0.x (7.0.40) and JDK 7u21.

Actual:
=======
If add the following line to logging.properties logging output does not change, as reported in the comment:

[[[
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=[%1$tY-%1$tm-%1$td %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS.%1$tL] %4$s: %5$s %6$s %n
]]]

But, if I add the following line, the output changes for all handlers. (At least for the console one, catalina.DATE.log and localhost.DATE.log files. Other log files are empty by default).

[[[
1catalina.java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=[%1$tY-%1$tm-%1$td %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS.%1$tL] %4$s: %5$s %6$s %n
]]]

Problem:
========
Oracle's SimpleFormatter.format is a static field, an thus is initialized only once.  While it is good that prefixed ""1catalina.*"" property works, this specific formatter cannot be configured per-handler. (One is free to implement their own formatter that does not use a static field there, or file an enhancement request to Oracle or OpenJDK).

The code in question is ClassLoaderLogManager.getProperty(String) which does

[[[
        if (prefix != null) {
            name = prefix + name;
        }
]]]

Thus is a prefix is active it tries only prefixed value of a property and never tries an unprefixed one.

Expected:
=========

With SimpleFormatter it would be more sense to configure it using an unprefixed property, regardless of which Handler is initialized first.

Workaround
===========
Change the values of ""handlers"", "".handlers"" properties so that an unprefixed handler is listed first.

In the default configuration that will be ConsoleHandler:

[[[
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, 1catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler, 2localhost.org.apache.juli.FileHandler, 3manager.org.apache.juli.FileHandler, 4host-manager.org.apache.juli.FileHandler

.handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, 1catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler
]]]

Alternatively, you can remove a prefix from one of other handlers.

If you do so, and if that handler uses a SimpleFormatter, then the unprefixed configuration property will work:
[[[
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=[%1$tY-%1$tm-%1$td %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS.%1$tL] %4$s: %5$s %6$s %n

(markt)|No TLD files were found in tools.jar when tools.jar is explicitly added to $CLASSPATH|"Since r1448831 (7.0.39) tools.jar is no longer mentioned in jarsToSkip

Steps to reproduce
1. Use Eclipse IDE, version for JavaEE developers.
I am using 3.7.2 (Indigo SR2) here.

2. Configure it to use a JDK.

3. Configure a new Server from Tomcat 7.0.39
In Java EE perspective, go to Servers view, right-click, choose ""New -> Server"" from context menu.

4. Examine launch configuration of the server.
In Servers view click on the server instance. A new page opens in Editor area. Click on ""Open launch configuration"" link there. Go to ""Classpath"" tab.

Note that the following JARs are in the classpath:
* bootstrap.jar
* tomcat-juli.jar
* tools.jar

5. Deploy a web application on this server and start it.
If you have configured logging (with -Djava.util.logging.config.file in the same launch configuration dialog), you may see complaints that there are no TLDs in tools.jar.

Consider adding the JAR to the tomcat.util.scan.DefaultJarScanner.jarsToSkip or org.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig.jarsToSkip property in CATALINA_BASE/conf/catalina.properties file.



There are two ways to fix this
a) add ""tools.jar"" to jarsToSkip property
b) do not scan jars in classpath.


In r1448831 in StandardJarScanner.java this b) would be
replace
  stopLoader = ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getParent();
with
  stopLoader = ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader();

I see a problem with such a change, though.

I think that there is no need to scan SystemClassLoader's classpath when Tomcat is launched via Bootstrap class.

I think that we have to scan SystemClassLoader's classpath when launched in embedded mode via Tomcat class. Is is because it does not set up classloaders hierarchy like it is done by Bootstrap."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54791

The issue is that the exception in bug 54801 does not provide any information on the file where it occurred. It does not show in which tag file it happened, and thus it is hard to follow.

helloWorld.tagx

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to  webapps\examples\WEB-INF\tags\
2. Delete ""helloWorld.tag"" file and put there ""helloWorld.tagx"" file attached to this issue.
The file contains the following plus AL header:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?>
<jsp:root xmlns:jsp=""http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page"" version=""2.0"">
<jsp:scriptlet><![CDATA[//
  // ${foo}
  out.println(""Hello, world!!"");
]]></jsp:scriptlet>
</jsp:root>

3. Start Tomcat and try to open the following page in a browser:
http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/jsp2/tagfiles/hello.jsp

ACTUAL result:
in current TC8 trunk:
org.xml.sax.SAXException: Body of scriptlet element must not contain any XML elements
  org.apache.jasper.compiler.JspDocumentParser.checkScriptingBody(JspDocumentParser.java:1332)
  org.apache.jasper.compiler.JspDocumentParser.endElement(JspDocumentParser.java:650)
	

This behaviour is caused by ""${foo}"" being present inside the scriptlet. If I remove that line, the page is displayed successfully.

EXPECTED RESULT
I think EL expressions should not be recognized inside of jsp:scriptlet, jsp:declaration or jsp:expression and should not trigger such an error.

As a confirmation, the following ""helloWorld.tag"" in JSP syntax compiles and executes successfully. Thus this issue is with XML syntax only,

<%
  // ${foo}
%>
Hello, world!++


Alternative solution could be to change the error message, but I think it is not the issue here,

When using Tomcat's jdbc-pool with the StatementCache interceptor (the default for TomEE 1.5.1), the actual java.sql.Statement.close() method is not called on the Statements. This causes severe memory leaks, at least with the MySQL driver.

I see what could be a bug in StatementCache#closeInvoked() which is called by the above method. Here is the code with my own comments added:
@Override
public void closeInvoked() {
    boolean shouldClose = true;
    if (cacheSize.get() < maxCacheSize) {
        // omitted for brievety
    }
    closed = true;
    // [1] I think ""delegate = null"" is done too soon
    delegate = null;
    if (shouldClose) {
        // check its body below
        super.closeInvoked();
    }
}

// This is super.closeInvoked()
public void closeInvoked() {
    if (getDelegate()!=null) {
        // never true when coming from
        // StatementCache#closeInvoked()
        // because of [1]
        try {
            getDelegate().close();
        }catch (SQLException ignore) {
        }
    }
    closed = true;
    delegate = null;
}

To test this, step into org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.test.TestStatementCache tests testPreparedStatementCache and testPreparedStatementCache2. The calls to Statement.close() are intercepted but never forwarded to the actual Statement. Perhaps some kind of mock could be used to make sure Statement.close() is called on each created Statement."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54732

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.39 (markt)|fix|54707|Further relax the parsing of DIGEST authentication headers to allow for buggy clients that quote values that RFC2617 states should not be quoted. (markt/kkolinko)|"Buggy Perl http clients cause tomcat digest auth to fail due to quoted nc values (e.g. nc=""00000001"")"|"This problem was discovered while trying to make the Perl LWP library work with tomcat where a path was being protected with digest authentication. 

Ultimately, this is a bug with Perl (see https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=43354), and it has been possibly fixed. 
HOWEVER, this requires users to update their perl libraries etc (a big pain for our customers and for us).

A simple fix to tomcat would solve this problem for us and make life good again.

A typical digest response header from perl looks like:

Authorization: Digest username=""joe"", realm=""ACME"", qop=""auth"", algorithm=""MD5"", uri=""/my/protected/path"", nonce=""1363130363664:71e75a43d7fdbfff8c54bece373058b8"", nc=""00000001"", cnonce=""513fb7fb"", response=""baeeff0b6b9b7e74e769630160d3725b"", message-digest=""d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"", opaque=""9C2C62C52D30A7D5707F75F5A813F113""

The entry nc=""00000001"" causes tomcat to reject the request.  It should be nc=00000001 (the perl client's mistake)

The following perl script demonstrates the problem:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use LWP;

&doGet(""myname"", ""mypassword"", ""myrealmname"", ""myhost"", ""8080"", ""/my/protected/path"");

sub doGet
{
    my ($username, $password, $realm, $host, $port, $uri) = @_;
    my $url = ""http://"".$host."":"".$port.$uri;

    print ""GET: $url\n"";

    my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new;

    $browser->agent('Debug Digest Problem');
    $browser->credentials($host."":"".$port,$realm,$username=>$password);

    my $response=$browser->get($url);

    print ""HTTP STATUS:"".$response->status_line.""\n"";
    print $response->content;
}

The fix should be in org.apache.tomcat.util.http.parser.HttpParser.java

Looking at build 7.0.37 code:

Around line 147:
                case 3:
                    // FIELD_TYPE_LHEX
                    value = readLhex(input);
                    break;

This switch is hit when the field is 'nc' (due to line 72 fieldTypes.put(""nc"", FIELD_TYPE_LHEX); ]

The method readLhex() does not tolerant quotes. (see line 434 and below).

A similar tomcat issue was fixed a while back for the quoted qop field. (the qop response field should also not be quoted, but tomcat handles this).

Also see line 375
     * This is not defined in any RFC. It is a special case to handle data from
     * buggy clients (known buggy clients include Microsoft IE 8 & 9, Apple
     * Safari for OSX and iOS) that add quotes to values that should be tokens.

Server software which tolerates this mistake in the perl client includes Apache and Spring's security filter 
(org.springframework.security.web.authentication.www.DigestAuthenticationFilter)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54707

If no values are specified for sslEnabledProtocols or ciphers use the default values for server sockets rather than the default values for client sockets. (markt)|HTTPS BIO/NIO connector does not enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 by default|"As users already noted [1], default HTTPS BIO/NIO connector in Tomcat 7.0.37 enables only SSLv3 and TLSv1, while Tomcat 6.0.36 enables SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2.

The reason for this change of behavior is that:

1. Tomcat 6, with default HTTPS connector configuration, does not call socket.setEnabledProtocols, thus enabling SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2, while

2. Tomcat 7, with default HTTPS connector configuration, calls socket.setEnabledProtocols(enabledProtocols), where enabledProtocols is obtained with: context.getDefaultSSLParameters().getProtocols(). This, contrary to not calling setEnabledProtocols at all, results in enabling only SSLv3 and TLSv1.


I propose that Tomcat 7 mimics Tomcat 6 behavior, and if attribute sslEnabledProtocols (in HTTPS connector in server.xml) is not set, then method socket.setEnabledProtocols is not invoked.

Everything is tested with Oracle JDK 1.7.0_15.

The problem comes from two different things:
1) If B2CConverter tries to convert a ByteChunk which ends in a character underflow it does not convert that last character and it is left in a buffer in B2CConver.

2) The B2CConverter in org.apache.catalina.connector.Request is not recycled with the rest of the objects. It looks like this is done intentionally based on the comment above it's declaration.

The issue with B2CConverter can be demonstrated with the code below, which is a simplification of what is done inside of CoyoteAdapter.convertURI():

<code>
B2CConverter conv = new B2CConverter(""UTF-8"");
ByteChunk bc = new ByteChunk();
CharChunk cc = new CharChunk();
byte[] bytes = { 0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x64, -8, -69, -73, -77 };

bc.append(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
cc.allocate(bc.getLength(), -1);
conv.convert(bc, cc, cc.getBuffer().length - cc.getEnd());
System.out.println(cc);

If the B2CConverter was recycled with everything else in Request this would prevent a previous request from corrupting the next request but it doesn't fix the issue that a character is dropped from the initial decode.

I tried playing with B2CConverter and the only way I could get the convert to get everything was by ignoring the limit argument and reading to the end of the stream. It looks like tomcat8 is moving in this direction with the move to NIO, however I tried playing with the latest B2CConverter and was still seeing issues with the given byte sequence."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54602

Invalid UTF-8 URIs will not cause an error but will make use of the replacement character when an error is detected. This will allow web applications to handle the URI which will most likely result in a 404 response. The fall-back to decoding with ISO-8859-1 if UTF-8 decoding fails has been removed. Invalid UTF-8 sequences in a request body will trigger an IOException. The way the decoder is used has also been improved. The notable change is that invalid sequences at the end of the input now trigger an error rather than being silently swallowed. (markt)|||

Reproduced in 6.0.36 though reported also in Tomcat 7.

If you set an environment variable $JAVA_OPTS (say, ‘export JAVA_OPTS=-server’) before running startup.sh, the Catalina JVM will include an environment variable JAVA_OPTS set to e.g. ‘-server -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager’. (This is not true if you do _not_ set JAVA_OPTS yourself: catalina.sh will modify a local shell variable but it does not export it.)

Normally this is harmless. But if the web application happens to fork an external process which happens to be one of the many Java applications that interpret $JAVA_OPTS when defined as JVM parameters, and that application uses java.util.logging at any point, then that application will generally crash because ClassLoaderLogManager is not in its classpath.

Indeed we did not really want to be passing -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager to the subprocess. If the user decided to specify some JAVA_OPTS for Tomcat, we should either pass this var unmodified to the JVM, or not pass it at all.

The fix seems simple enough (patch format upon request): in catalina.sh, replace

if [ -z ""$LOGGING_MANAGER"" ]; then
  JAVA_OPTS=""$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager""
else
  JAVA_OPTS=""$JAVA_OPTS $LOGGING_MANAGER""
fi

with

if [ -z ""$LOGGING_MANAGER"" ]; then
  LOGGING_MANAGER=-Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager
fi
CATALINA_JAVA_OPTS=""$JAVA_OPTS $LOGGING_MANAGER""

and then replace subsequent references to $JAVA_OPTS with $CATALINA_JAVA_OPTS. Optionally also

unset JAVA_OPTS

since any JVM options specified for the web server are likely to be inappropriate for other Java processes it spawns (though https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/pull/2 suggests otherwise).

The workaround in the web application is to sanitize the JAVA_OPTS environment variable before forking the subprocess, deleting the ClassLoaderLogManager configuration if found."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54601

org.apache.catalina.authenticator.DigestAuthenticator
org.apache.catalina.authenticator.DigestAuthenticator.NonceInfo

Scenario:
A multithreaded client sends two requests within one millisecond. The DigestAuthenticator creates for each request a nonce as well as a NonceInfo instance. The two nonces are equal, as they were created within the same millisecond. When writing data into the cache (method generateNonce()), the second NonceInfo instance overwrites the first one (same key!).

Problem:
The two client threads then send a second request with a digest authentication header. In both requests, “nc” (nonce count) is equal “1”, as the nonce has been newly created. In the NonceInfo of the first request, array “seen” is set to “true” for index ((nonceCount + offset) % seen.length). In the second request the same NonceInfo instance is used, as the instance is retrieved from map “nonces” using “nonce” as a key, that is, in both requests the same key is used. Consequently, method “nonceCountValid()“ returns „false“, as  seen[(nonceCount + offset) % seen.length)] has already been set to „true“.  Therefore the authentication fails, although the client has sent a valid digest authentication header.

Working with multi-threaded clients with many requests, digest authentication does not function reliably."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54521

Project for reproduction of bug

I've recently observed a bug in Tomcat 7 that is causing our servers to fail to start-up, with the root cause being that, in response to a JMX request, Tomcat 7 is loading our servlet on a Thread whose contextClassLoader is NOT that of the web application.  This may lead to various problems; in our case, it leads to failure of Spring to find the requisite XSDs that are present in jars in our web app's WEB-INF/lib directory.

Here is the stack trace that is reported for Tomcat7.0.35 + Spring 3.1.1:

I've attached a simple Maven-based WAR project that can reproduce this -- see the README for exact steps.

In this case, the exception will occur, but after the artificially imposed 30 second delay completes, the servlet appears to load fine.  

In our actual systems, the servlet appears to remain in an incompletely loaded state.  My hypothesis is that this is timing-related... if StandardWrapper.allocate does not complete before the main thread that is loading the web application correctly, then I think the main thread adds a reference to the mis-loaded servlet, and the subsequent deallocate call in StandardWrapper.isSingleThreadModel does not unload the servlet, causing it to remain in its impaired state.

Please investigate this bug, since it is likely to affect users combining Tomcat + Spring WebMVC + JMX monitoring, which I believe to be a common use case."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54534

Patch to fix the bug

In my case client is processing user's InputStream and then sending data in chunks to server. At server end I read till EOF.
Client can be simple Java program or a web application. 

I am facing issue when client gets error on user's InputStream and closes connection with server. In that case ChunkedInputFilter is returning -1.
I have added logs and confirmed that endChunk is false.
Issue was fixed after I added following just before ""return result;""

if (result == -1 && !endChunk)
			throw new EOFException(""Unexpected end of stream while reading chunk body"");

I think ChunkedInputFilter should return -1 only when it gets endChunk.

Also, from client end I am always sending complete chunk. So, in ChunkedInputFilter I should get EOF from socket stream while reading next chunk header (which is handled properly in ChunkedInputFilter) but that is not happening.

The problem is that when the application uses 'injection-target' declarations in 

org.apache.catalina.core.DefaultInstanceManager.populateAnnotationsCache(Class<?>, Map<String, String>)

only the first setter method is evaluated and the rest are skipped.


I would like to propose a patch and test case.

I'm looking forward to your comments.

Thoughts:
1. We should catch throwables in those checkFor**Leaks methods. It should not cause a ""failed to stop component"" failure.
2. In that method there are many calls to ""table[j]"". The array member should be evaluated only once, so that it does not become null unexpectedly."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54497

Modified ciphers and sslEnabledProtocols option pruning to not silently revert to JVM defaults when none of the options specified are supported - new behaviour is to warn and explicitly enable no options. (timw)|NIO and BIO connectors handle unsupported SSL ciphers and sslEnabledProtocols differently|"The NIO and BIO connectors share (most of) a JSSE based SSLImplementation, but differ in their handling of the ciphers and sslEnabledProtocols attributes.

The NIO connector sets the configured values for both attributes directly on the SSLEngine, which will fail immediately if any of them are unsupported. This makes creating a portable/superset collection of ciphers impossible - i.e. IBM JDKs do not support many of the cipher suite names used by JSSE and vice versa (usually TLS_ vs SSL_ prefixes differ) and the supported options differ between Java 6/7 etc.

The BIO connector attempts to filter the specified values down to those supported by the SSL implementation, but has issues as well: if none of the specified ciphers/protocols are supported it will silently use the defaults of the SSL implementation, which can lead to unexpectedly (and unwittingly) insecure configurations.

I propose to:
 - modify the NIO connector to use the same logic as the BIO connector to filter requested ciphers/protocols to supported values (by placing these operations on the SSLUtil interface). 
 - modify the ciphers/protocols filtering logic to treat an explicit list of unsupported options as setting no supported ciphers/protocols and warn when this is done (it will also fail visibly with errors if SSL connections are attempted)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54406

Patch for JspContextWrapper.java

JspContextWrapper.getServletContext, JspContextWrapper.findAttribute and JspContextWrapper.getELContext take much time because there are many cascaded tag files. 

For example:
 <tag1>
 <tag2>
 <tag3>
 <tag4/>
 </tag3>
 </tag2>
 </tag1>

When calling JspContextWrapper(tag4).getServletContext from tag4, it will call JspContextWrapper(tag3).getServletContext --> JspContextWrapper(tag2).getServletContext --> JspContextWrapper(tag1).getServletContext --> PageContext.getServletContext.

If the root PageContext can be held in JspConextWrapper, those page,session,application scopes calling can go directy to this root PageContext.

This does not exist. Creating an init-param with this value has no effect. The correct init-param is ""compilerClassName,"" not ""compiler.""

Related, this option is very poorly documented. There is no indication about what this value should be.

Hello, 

I noticed that there is a jsp compilation problem when the application context root contains white spaces.

Steps to reproduce:
Deploy the attached application and request:
http://<host>:<port>/Space%20AppTest/testClassInvoker.jsp

Then the following exception is received in response:

I would like to propose a small patch that fixes this. The fix simply moves the decoding in org.apache.naming.resources.DirContextURLConnection.connect() method a little bit earlier.
Without the fix path.startsWith(contextPath + ""/"") check returns false in our case, as contexPath is in decoded form, while path is not decoded yet.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.35 (markt)|fix|54256|Improve error reporting when a JAR file fails extension validation by including the name of the JAR file in the exception. (markt)|Enhance Exception reporting on JAR file error|"(I posted this to the mailing list on Oct 28, 2011, but didn't end up creating a report on it until now.  I have the same error with Tomcat 7.)

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

I have an exception (appended below), and I think it would be nice to have more information about what is going on.

If I had more context, it would help me find the cause of my problem much more quickly.  For example, if the exception indicated what the file/resource that was having the problem was, it would speed up troubleshooting immensely.

HOW TO REPRODUCE:

In a JAR file contained in WAR file's WEB-INF/lib folder:  Change the MANIFEST.MF file in the JAR file.  Put in a line with ONLY ""Class-Path:"".  Note there is no space after the period, which is what causes the error.  During load of the application, the exception which I have appended at the end of this message will show up.

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENT:

My suggestion would be to modify ExtensionValidator.validateApplication(...), around line 195.  This is the location that actually knows about what the resource is.  It would be nice if the IOException was caught, and information about the Resource was added to the exception, probably by wrapping the exception.

Because I have not gone through the overhead of getting a version of Tomcat running from source, these changes have not been compiled and tested, but I think the suggestion is relatively straight-forward.

Here are the suggested code changes:

First code change - move the definition of ""resource"" outside of the try/catch:

         // Locate the Manifests for all bundled JARs
         Resource resource = null; // ADDED
         NamingEnumeration<Binding> ne = null;

Second code change - make the existing declaration of ""resource"" just an assignment:

                 resource = (Resource) obj; // MODIFIED
                 inputStream = resource.streamContent();
                 Manifest jmanifest = getManifest(inputStream);

Third code change: add a catch clause and re-throw:

         } catch (NamingException nex) {
             // Jump out of the check for this application because it
             // has no resources
         } catch (IOException ioex) { // ADDED
             throw new IOException(""validation problem in "" + resource.toString(), ioex); // ADDED
         } finally {

The problem is that the resource may not have a proper toString().  I would suggest changing FileDirContext:898 (inner class=FileResource) to have a toString method, something along the lines of:

         public String toString() { // ADDED
             return file == null ? ""null"" : file.toString(); // ADDED
         } // ADDED

Note: about this, in the original email thread, Konstantin Kolinko said:
""Not sure about FileResource.toString(), but adding a catch for IOException looks like doable.""


Finally, here's the exception:

To reproduce:
1.	Deploy the attached application, which:
1.1.	Has a white space in its name;
1.2.	Includes a web fragment;
2.	The web app extraction is disabled (through unpackWARs=""false"" Host attribute in the server.xml)
Note that the fix for Bug 54249 should be first applied (to avoid other exceptions prior the questioned one).

I would like to propose a small fix for this:
A substring start position is incorrectly calculated based on a string in decoded form (e.g. “/Fragment Example”), while the substring itself is made on an encoded string (e.g. “/localhost/Fragment%20Example/WEB-INF/classes/com”). The proposed fix is simply to encode the string used for the calculations.

(kkolinko)|In MapperListener.lifecycleEvent(..): check state of parent before calling registerWrapper()|"In r1429745 I added a test to trunk that test what happens if the first attempt to start a Context fails, the cause of the failure is removed, and then the context is started for the second time.

The test is TestStandardContext.testBug46243().

It runs successfully, but the following message is logged:

Jan 07, 2013 3:02:07 PM org.apache.catalina.mapper.Mapper addWrapper

This happens when the context is started for the second time. If I put a breakpoint on the line that logs the message, the stack trace is (running Tomcat trunk):

  StandardContext(LifecycleBase).start() line: 150	
  TestStandardContext.testBug46243() line: 109	

================================================
My understanding is the following:

1. When Tomcat starts, registration into the mapper is performed by StandardService.startInternal().
Stack trace:
  Mapper.addHost(String, String[], Host) line: 89	
  MapperListener.registerHost(Host) line: 287	
  MapperListener.startInternal() line: 107

  TomcatBaseTest$TomcatWithFastSessionIDs.start() line: 421	
  TestStandardContext.testBug46243() line: 89	

2. The Context that failed to start is skipped by MapperListener.registerHost(), thanks to getState().isAvailable() check there.

3. The Mapper.addWrapper() call (the one that prints that ""No context found"" message) happens when AFTER_START_EVENT is processed for the Wrapper. At this moment the StandardContext.startInternal() has not completed yet and thus the context has not been registered by the mapper.

4. Nothing serious happens, besides the message, because when StandardContext.startInternal() completes, the AFTER_START_EVENT for the Context is processed. This is when the Context and the Wrappers that it contains are registered.

Thus I think there should be a check either in MapperListener.lifecycleEvent() or in MapperListener.registerWrapper() that tests whether getContainer().getState().isAvailable() is true."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54380

Tomcat deployed the application without any warning, but when running the application only the last referenced servlet was working (like if the mapping of the first has been overwritten by the last in the XML file).

I made additional tests using annotations in servlets, and the behavior of having more than one servlet with same mapping causes random access to one or another (I cannot determine a predictable way).

In order to prevent breaking existing applications, I would like to have just a ""big warning"" in the log at startup and/or deployment of the application that have more than one servlet mapped to same URL.

It appears via review of the Tomcat code, that the recycle() method in B2CConverter simply ensures the socket's data has been completely flushed and the underlying InputStream doesn't get reset (don't really know if there is a way to do this without re-instantiating it) to ensure subsequent requests BOM is consumed. I proved this as a test by adding a call to reset() within the recycle() method which re-instantiates the underlying InputStreams and the problem resolved itself.

Investigation results:

I was able to debug and trace the exception and found that the Excpetion
is caused by a '.tag', I'm including in my JSP, which has no
UnloadHandle assigned when processed in
org.apache.jasper.compiler.JspRuntimeContext.checkUnload() line 610:
jspQueue.remove(jsw.getUnloadHandle());

Because jsw.getUnloadHandle() returns null, jspQueue.remove() fails and
is throwing the NullPointerException everytime, aborting the ""unload"".



Reproducing the exceptiopn:

It looks like the exception appears only when ""maxLoadedJsps"" and "" jspIdleTimeout"" are set to a value >0 in tomcat/conf/web.xml and "".tag"" files are used with jsp-scriptlets.

Web.xml changes:
        <init-param>
            <param-name>maxLoadedJsps</param-name>
            <param-value>1000</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>jspIdleTimeout</param-name>
            <param-value>5</param-value>
        </init-param>


The exception can be observed in the example ""Tag Files"" -> ""Display Products Example"" but you have to edit the WEB-INF/tags/displayProducts.tag and append the following example scriptlet:

<%
 String test = ""this is ="";
 if (normalPrice != null)
  test = test + normalPrice + "" something"";
 else
  test = test + onSale + ""="";
 StringBuilder tags=new StringBuilder(test);
 tags.append(""."").append(test).append(""...""); // change here
 test = tags.toString();
 request.setAttribute(""test"", test);
%>
<%=test %>

Start Tomcat and invoke the example jsp http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/jsp2/tagfiles/products.jsp

Wait and observe the catalina.out (or tomcat output) for exceptions. Normaly the exception won't appear. Now edit the previously added scriplet in WEB-INF/tags/displayProducts.tag modifying any string in one of the append statements.
Call the example jsp again, tomcat should recompile the tag, wait and observe again your tomcat output.
Do not shutdown or restart tomcat between these steps! Tomcat should recompile the tag on the fly.

Patch by Brian Burch. (markt)|TestNonLoginAndBasicAuthenticator does not test session timeout properly|"Created attachment 29621 [details]
Extensive update to the test class to demonstrate session timeout properly

While working on a new test case for a different Authenticator, I decided to follow the timeout test case in this class. Although all the test cases currently run successfully, I discovered three fundamental flaws in the existing timeout test case:

1. The BasicAuthenticator does not create a session by default, so there was no session to actually timeout.
2. Context.setSessionTimeout() was called with a timeout in seconds, but this method expects a timeout argument in minutes.
3. The presence of 401 Unauthorized status was intended to confirm a session timeout, but it was erroneously succeeding because no credentials were supplied when attempting to re-access the protected resource.

The attached patch is quite extensive, but cannot easily be broken into smaller units:
1. The AuthenticatorBase.setAlwaysUseSession variable can now be manipulated by test cases.
2. The doTestBasic method has been reimplemented so that it only makes a single HTTP GET request (instead of two).
3. doTestBasic can now be controlled to authenticate or not, and it will also harvest a session cookie and can also supply that cookie in subsequent requests.
4. The doTestNonLogin method can be controlled to send a saved session cookie.
5. The erroneous timeout test case has been reimplemented has been renamed and properly commented to explain that it is not testing a timeout.
6. A new session persistence test case has been added.
7. A new session persistence timeout test case has been added.
8. Raw boolean control flags have been replaced with self-documenting constants.
9. Helpful comments have been added in some places where the logic is not self-evident.

The ErrorReportValve must react on response.isError() == true only. Regardless of the status code or the content count.

I found that our SlowQueryReportJmx mbean was not being deregistered during webapp shutdown.  I tracked this down to a NPE.  The interceptor properties are not being set (as is done in setupConnection) prior to the pool close callback.

ConnectionPool.close(boolean) poolClosed callback produces NPE in SlowQueryReportJmx.

Sounds reasonable to set properties any time you need to instantiate interceptors.

Servlet 3.0 Spec. says that


2.3.3.3 Asynchronous processing

...

In the event that an asynchronous operation times out, the container must run 
through the following steps: 
■ Invoke the AsyncListener.onTimeout method on all the AsyncListener 
instances registered with the ServletRequest on which the asynchronous 
operation was initiated. 
■ If none of the listeners called AsyncContext.complete() or any of the 
AsyncContext.dispatch methods, perform an error dispatch with a status 
code equal to HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR. 
■ If no matching error page was found, or the error page did not call 
AsyncContext.complete() or any of the AsyncContext.dispatch 
methods, the container MUST call AsyncContext.complete().

(servlet-3_0-mrel-spec.pdf / pdf page 40, Spec page 18)


In other words, if there are no AsyncListeners which calls AsyncContext.complete() or any of the 
AsyncContext.dispatch, the container must perform an error dispatch with 500 error code.

But tomcat 7 does not send 500 error response. It sends 200 OK.

In org.apache.catalina.core.AsyncContextImpl.timeout(), 

                if (listenerInvoked) {
                    request.getCoyoteRequest().action(

it just calls complete(). So I think it must be spec violation.

(markt)|CometEvent.END event is not sent on a suspended socket disconnect when running with Tomcat Native (tcnative-1.dll) on Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 or newer.|"Created attachment 29492 [details]
Tomcat 7.0.32 source file with the bugfix

Our Web application uses an asynchronous 3.0 servlet (via Atmosphere 1.0, actually) to send notification messages to clients connected via long-running sockets (e.g., HTTP streaming, long polling, etc.) I found a bug where Tomcat was not sending the CometEvent.END event on x64 platforms that used Tomcat Native when a socket would disconnect (e.g., by pressing CTRL-C from an HTTP GET curl command).  

After narrowing it down and debugging the Tomcat 7.0.32 source, I tracked the problem down to org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.java.  Due to the way that APR handles socket polling in Tomcat Native, the bug only occurs on Windows platforms that 1) use tcnative-1.dll, and 2) are Vista/Server 2008 or newer.  Here is what is happening:

1) On startup, APR in tcnative-1.dll looks for a method named ""WSAPoll"" method in Ws2_32.dll.  If it finds it, it assigns that function as the function to use to poll sockets.  Otherwise, it falls back to the legacy method of polling sockets.  WSAPoll is only present on Windows Vista/Server 2008 or newer.

2) In org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint, the doPoll(long pollset) method invokes Poll.poll(pollset, pollTime, desc, true), which delegates the call to tcnative-1.dll if present.

3) If doPoll returns > 0, it means that at least one socket requires processing, so it falls through to this block in the doPoll method AprEndpoint.java (comments added below marked with ""{DB}""):

          for (int n = 0; n < rv; n++) {
              // Check for failed sockets and hand this socket off to a worker
              if (((desc[n*2] & Poll.APR_POLLHUP) == Poll.APR_POLLHUP)   // {DB} only the WSAPoll method sets the APR_POLLHUP flag when a socket disconnects; neither the legacy tcnative polling method nor the pure Java Coyote polling method sets this flag (which is fine)
                      || ((desc[n*2] & Poll.APR_POLLERR) == Poll.APR_POLLERR)
                      || (comet && (!processSocket(desc[n*2+1], SocketStatus.OPEN)))  // {DB} this line is executed for comet sockets if WSAPoll is not available on this platform (e.g., pre-Vista/Server 2008) or if tcnative-1.dll is not present.  (This is also fine.)
                      || (!comet && (!processSocket(desc[n*2+1])))) {
                  // Close socket and clear pool
                  if (comet) {
                      processSocket(desc[n*2+1], SocketStatus.DISCONNECT);  // {DB} this is only reached if tcnative-1.dll is present and we are running on Vista/Server 2008 or newer.  This is OK, but there is a bug with SocketStatus.DISCONNECT handling for comet sockets in processSocket (described in the next step)
                  } else {
                      destroySocket(desc[n*2+1]);
                  }
              }
          }

 4) The processSocket(long socket, SocketStatus status) method fires up a SocketEventProcessor and runs it, which excutes this:
 
        Handler.SocketState state = handler.process(socket, status);  // {DB} this does not send CometEvent.END for comet if status == SocketStatus.DISCONNECT (details in next steps)
        if (state == Handler.SocketState.CLOSED) {
            // Close socket and pool
            destroySocket(socket.getSocket().longValue());  // {DB} this closes the socket and frees it for reuse, but since the Comet application was not notified that the socket went away, the next time it tries to send data down the socket it either crashes the JVM or writes the data to the response which is now owned by somebody else.  Chaos ensues.
            socket = null;
        }

  5) When running Tomcat Native, the handler.process(socket, status) method is implemented by org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol$Http11ConnectionHandler, which extends AbstractConnectionHandler defined as an inner class in org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.  The method and the fix that I made on my test instance are shown below [the fix was to add '&& (!processor.isComet())' to the beginning condition of the 'if' block]:

              // {DB}       For all other cases status == SocketStatus.OPEN here even if a disconnect has occurred, so it falls through to the '} else if (processor.isComet()) {' line all is well.

              if ( (status == SocketStatus.DISCONNECT) && (!processor.isComet()) ) {  // <<<<<< {DB} BUGFIX: if comet, must allow processor.event(SocketStatus.DISCONNECT) later in the 'if' block to send the Comet.END event and return SocketState.CLOSED

              } else if (processor.isAsync() || state == SocketState.ASYNC_END) {
                  state = processor.asyncDispatch(status);
              } else if (processor.isComet()) {
                  state = processor.event(status);  // {DB} this sends CometEvent.END and returns SocketState.CLOSED if status == SocketStatus.DISCONNECT, which is what we want

After I made the fix above and deployed the updated tomcat-coyote.jar I am now getting the CometEvent.END events as expected when using Tomcat Native on Windows 7.  We are using Atmosphere (which uses Comet) for our next release, but we will need this Tomcat bugfix before we can deploy.  We could ship a custom patched tomcat-coyote.jar but obviously we would prefer to have an official fix in the next Tomcat patch release so we could just deploy that.  

The fix I made above works for me, but if you need to reproduce the problem, all you need to do is:
  1) Install Tomcat 7.0.32 along with Tomcat Native on a Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 PC (I was using a 64-bit Windows 7 PC).
  2) Run a servlet that:  
      a) implements org.apache.catalina.comet.CometProcessor, and 
      b) logs the CometEvents received, and 
      c) suspends the HttpRequest when it receives one.
  3) Connect to that servlet by doing an HTTP GET via Curl.
  4) Press CTRL-C to abort the socket connection.  The CometEvent.END event is never fired.

Patch for PageContextImpl.java

XmlEscape is used to do escape special characters for EL result.
 Currently it gets characters from String one by one and check whether the char is special character or not, than put the char into a StringBuilder.

Most cases the string has no such special characters, However, it always creates a new StringBuilder than do such iteration.

It's better to check whether there is any special characters first.
 If there is special character, then do create a StringBuilder and put those characters in front of te special character into the StringBuilder. 
Again, check the string by character one by one similar as the original logic.

The issue is that in certain situations some ELResolvers are called needlessly. For example, if base != null, calling getValue() on ImplicitObjectELResolver is unnecessary.

JSP file to reproduce compilation error

I have a JSP file that contained a comment line as follows:

Such a JSP compiles in Tomcat 7.0.30, but it does not compile in 7.0.32.  I’ve attached a copy of a test file, which compiles in 7.0.30, but not in 7.0.32.  The only related change I see in the release notes is https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53713.  

From reading the JSP 2.2 spec, it appears that absent a specific comment about whitespace, the rules of XML shall apply, which effectively means whitespace is ignored.  This would seem to indicate this could be a regression introduced in 7.0.32, but since the spec is somewhat vague in the section about comments,

The code that the plugin generates calls value.toString(), default.toString() and passes these String values to the static method Out.output(...). This new method was added in r1401816.

I think the output() method should accept Objects instead of Strings, because the following is wrong:

1. The evaluation of default.toString() is not needed at all if the default is not used.

2. The JSTL spec (1.1, 1.2) says that there is special processing if value is java.io.Reader. There is no such processing in the current code. (It seems that this feature was added in JSTL 1.1).

[quote]
If the result of the evaluation is not a java.io.Reader object, then it is coerced to
a String and is subsequently emitted into the current JspWriter object.

If the result of the evaluation is a java.io.Reader object, data is first read from the

This is because OutOfMemoryError's caused by PermGen pool exhaustion are fatal for the server and are hard to predict, as they are are not visible from the simple Free/Max/Total Heap statistics.

Technically speaking, the information is provided by ""MemoryPool"" MBeans. It is easier to display all memory pools at once rather than to search for specific one.

The beans could be obtained via a query, e.g. [1], but it is much easier to use standard API that is available in Java SE [2].

Do not work well in static cluster.

First side (ie one thread):
* call to TcpFailureDetector.heartbeat()
* call to checkMembers(false)
* call to performBasicCheck() in synchronized(membership)
* in performBasicCheck, for a missing static node:
*   add ""missing"" member to membership with membership.memberAlive(m)
*       HERE THE SECOND THREAD HAVE SOME TIME TO WORK
*   check it with memberAlive(m)
*   remove it since if it doesn't exist

Second side (ie another thread):
* some call to channel.getMembers() like what the done by AbstractReplicatedMap
* this call will call the TcpFailureDetector.getMembers()
* this one could return a wrong value since it can contains unavailable nodes

Note:
* synchronize on membership isn't use by TcpFailureDetector in getMember(), getMembers(), hasMembers(), neither in Membership equivalent method (maybe because it's too heavy to lock every thread while the TcpFailureDetector check if node are alive).

It must not be an issue for AbstractReplicatedMap since with or without TcpFailureDetector a node could disapear while replicated map try to use it.
But ReplicatedMap use always Channel.SEND_OPTIONS_DEFAULT where the value is Channel.SEND_OPTIONS_USE_ACK. So a message sent to a missing node will fail with an exception.

Personnaly I override TcpFailureDetector.heartbeat() to avoid performBasicCheck() if I use a static configuration (TcpPingInterceptor call performForcedCheck()).
But this doesn't fix ReplicatedMap issue.

Better fix could avoid adding missing member to membership list:
* Add a method like memberAlive(MemberImpl) to Membership without side effect (add the member)
* in TcpFailureDetector.performBasicCheck(): check this new method before adding the node


This doesn't fix the AbstractReplicatedMap issue which work always with acknoledge from other nodes.


Same code for Tomcat 6.

Christopher Schultz suggested these approaches might be possible (on the Tomcat user list):

1. Modify the parallel deployment code to register an MBean
NotificationListener that filters for useful events (such as expiring
session notifications on the outgoing webapp).

2. When the listener receives a notification, check the current state
(e.g. session count=0; or, I suppose you could make this a part of
your filter in step #1). If session count = 0, start a new thread that
stops the outgoing webapp and de-registers the listener.

Or.

1. Install a SessionEventListener that counts-down the sessions
(you'll have to get the count from JMX, I suppose) until they equal 0,
then starts a new thread that ... etc.

Or.

1. Install a Timer thread that polls at intervals (1 minute?) to see
if all the sessions are dead and then starts a thread ... etc.

The first idea seems the cleanest, though Tomcat might not actually
fire MBean events for things like session count changing."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52777

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.30 (markt)|fix|53498|Fix atomicity bugs in use of concurrent collections. Based on a patch by Yu Lin. (markt)|Atomicity violation bugs because of misusing concurrent collections|"Created attachment 29021 [details]
The patch that may fix the atomicity violation bugs.

My name is Yu Lin. I'm a Ph.D. student in the CS department at
UIUC. I'm currently doing research on mining Java concurrent library
misusages. I found some misusages of ConcurrentHashMap in Tomcat
7.0.28, which may result in potential atomicity violation bugs or harm
the performance.

The code below is a snapshot of the code in file
java/org/apache/catalina/core/ApplicationContext.java from line 761 to
767 and line 1262 to 1266

L761        found = attributes.containsKey(name);
L762        if (found) {
L763            value = attributes.get(name);
L764            attributes.remove(name);
L765        } else {
L766            return;
L767        }
            ...
L1262       if (parameters.containsKey(name)) {
L1263           return false;
L1264       }
L1265
L1266       parameters.put(name, value);

In the code above, an atomicity violation may occur between lines 762
and 763. Suppose thread T1 executes line 761 and finds that the
concurrent hashmap ""attributes"" contains the key ""name"". Before thread
T1 executes line 763, another thread T2 removes the ""name"" key from
""attributes"". Now thread T1 resumes execution at line 763 and will get
a null value for ""name"". Then the next line will throw a
NullPointerException when invoking the method on ""name"".

Second, the snapshot above has another atomicity violation. Let's look
at lines 1262 and 1266. Suppose a thread T1 executes line 1262 and
finds out the concurrent hashmap dose not contain the key
""name"". Before it gets to execute line 1266, another thread T2 puts a
pair <name, v> in the concurrent hashmap ""parameters"". Now thread T1
resumes execution and it will overwrite the value written by thread
T2. Thus, the code no longer preserves the ""put-if-absent"" semantics.

I found some similar misusages in other files:

In java/org/apache/catalina/ha/context/ReplicatedContext.java, similar
atomicity violation may occur when another thread T2 remove the key
""name"" from concurrent hashmap ""tomcatAttributes"" before thread T1
executes line 172.

In java/org/apache/catalina/startup/HostConfig.java, suppose thread T1
executes line 1480 and finds out the concurrent hashmap dose not
contain the key ""contextName"". Before it executes line 1509, another
thread T2 puts a pair <contextName, v> in the concurrent hashmap
""deployed"". Now thread T1 resumes execution and it will overwrite the
value written by thread T2. Indeed, the putIfAbsent method shoule be
used rather than put method at line 1509."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53498

A demo app that demonstrates the problem. Issue a request to /serv1 and check the produced 'Location' response header

Issuing a redirect like:

  response.sendRedirect(""./serv2"");

will lead to a response header like:

  Location:http://localhost:8080/./serv2

and this causes problems for some not that smart user agents like Internet Explorer and JMeter.

The problem has been reported few times in Apache Wicket's Jira.
Wicket works only with relative urls and lets the web container to make them absolute when a redirect is needed. But it seems only Tomcat produces absolute urls with '../' and/or './' inside and let the user agent to normalize them. Other web containers normalize the url at the server side and make user agents life easier.

If the call fails, a subsequent attempt to create a new FileOutputStream for a file in the (failed-to-create) directory results in a FileNotFoundException with the whole filename as the message. Here is an example from the above tomcat-user original post:

The analogous code in the current trunk is:

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.30 (markt)|fix|53584|Ignore path parameters when comparing URIs for FORM authentication. This prevents users being prompted twice for passwords when logging in when session IDs are being encoded as path parameters. (markt)|Forms authentication without cookies requires double submission in 6.0.33|"Created attachment 29093 [details]
Standalone test app which reproduces the issue

We have an application which uses the forms authentication provided by Servlet specification and is configured store session IDs in the URL rather than using cookies. This configuration has been working as expected under Tomcat 6.0.32 and earlier.

On upgrading to Tomcat 6.0.33 or 6.0.35 this combination no longer works as expected. Specifically, when a user initially submits the login form they are immediately returned back to the form-login-page. Submitting the login form a second time allows them to log in. The only difference I have been able to spot between the first and second form submission is for the second submission the request attribute ""javax.servlet.forward.request_uri"" now has the jsessionid appended to the URL.

Attached is a standalone WAR which reliably reproduces the problem with 6.0.33 and 6.0.35. Steps to reproduce:

1) Unpack tomcat 6.0.33. I used windows version ""apache-tomcat-6.0.33-windows-x86.zip"".
2) Drop forms-auth-test.war into the webapps directory.
3) Disable cookies by editing conf/context.xml:
<Context cookies=""false"">
    ....
</Context>

4) Add a user to authenticated with to conf/tomcat-users.xml:
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename=""tomcat""/>
  <user username=""tomcat"" password=""tomcat"" roles=""tomcat""/>
</tomcat-users>

5) Launch tomcat, I used ""bin/catalina.bat start"".
6) Navigate to http://localhost:8080/forms-auth-test/index.jsp
7) Enter user:tomcat pass:tomcat (should be prefilled). Click login.
8) Observe that you are returned to the login page (with a session ID in the URL this time).
9) Enter the username and password again and click login.
10) Login should succeed this time.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.30 (markt)|fix|53623|When performing a asynchronous dispatch after series of forwards, ensure that the request properties are correct for the request at each stage. (markt)|Incorrect request properties after AsyncContext.dispatch|"In a scenario that involves a forward, a call to startAsync, and then dispatch(path), the properties of the request after the dispatch do not match the path and query params used to send the dispatch.

A project demonstrating the issue:
https://github.com/rstoyanchev/dispatch-test

Build and deploy the sources in the 'tomcat-issue-repro' branch. From the home page of the deployed application, select the ""Dispatch via AsyncContext"" scenario. 

The scenario involves a couple of forwards from ServletA to Servlet B and then ServletC, which in turn starts a thread and dispatches to Servlet D that forwards to a JSP. See WebAppInitializer.setupDispatchScenario(ServletContext) for details on the setup.

The log output shows the content of the request as each Servlet is entered. It all looks as expected until after the dispatch to ServletD where the requestUri, servletPath, and pathInfo are for ServletC.

---

The second scenario on the home page, ""Dispatch via AsyncContext and wrap request"", wraps the request and that yields slightly different (but also incorrect) results. The requestUri/servletPath/pathInfo and also the parameterMap, in the application thread and after dispatch, both match the state of the request in ServletA.

---

FWIW there are also a couple of similar scenarios that use forwarding instead of dispatching. The ""Forward via RequestDispatcher"" scenario appears to work all the way through while the ""Forward via RequestDispatcher and wrap request"" almost works except the state of the request in the async thread only matches that of ServletA."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53623

A project demonstrating the issue:
https://github.com/rstoyanchev/dispatch-test

Build and deploy the source in the 'tomcat-issue-repro'. From the home page of the deployed application, select the ""Redirect"" scenario. The scenario involves Servlet ""RedirectA"" that creates a thread and dispatches to Servlet ""RedirectB"", which in turn redirects to Servlet ""RedirectC"" and that forwards to a simple JSP page. Instead of the JSP page rendering, you should see a blank page and the log output will show that processing ended at ServletC.

For details on the setup see WebAppInitializer.setupRedirectScenario(ServletContext).

---

FWIW if a forward is used instead of a dispatch from the async thread, the scenario works. To do that, modify the line that creates servlet ""RedirectA"" to be ForwardingAsyncServlet instead of DispatchingAsyncServlet.

Small sample web app

When a servlet adds enough information to a response exceed the maxHttpHeaderSize limitconfigured for an HTTP 1.1 connector, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown by Tomcat (example stacktrace below), and the connection is closed without writing any data.

In a scenario like this, should a response with a status of 500 be returned to indicate a server error? (and perhaps the server should log a message indicating that the limit has been exceeded for a response, instead of throwing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?)



This issue can be reproduced by testing with a servlet that implements this contrived doGet method (sample application with this is attached):

	protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		char[] bigBuffer = new char[1024 * 8];
		Arrays.fill(bigBuffer, 'a');
		response.setHeader(""x-example"", new String(bigBuffer));
		
		response.setContentType(""text/plain"");
		response.setCharacterEncoding(""ISO-8859-1"");

		Writer out = response.getWriter();
		out.write(""Hello!"");
		out.close();
	}


This has been observed under the following configurations:

Tomcat 6.0.26/Oracle JDK 1.6.0_25 (64-bit)/SUSE Linux 10
Tomcat 6.0.35/Oracle JDK 1.7.0 (64-bit)/Windows 7

- Tomcat is not running behind a web server in any of these configurations

- The connector being used in both cases is Coyote HTTP/1.1

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.30 (markt)|fix|53702|When merging web.xml fragments, allow for <jsp-property-group> elements having multiple <url-pattern> elements. (markt)|Only the last url-pattern from jsp-property-group is processed|"Created attachment 29215 [details]
Modified files from the ROOT webapp

According to XSDs (jsp_2_0.xsd, jsp_2_1.xsd, jsp_2_2.xsd), the ""url-pattern"" can occur more than once in the same ""jsp-property-group"".

[[[
  <xsd:complexType name=""jsp-property-groupType"">
...
      <xsd:element name=""url-pattern""
                   type=""javaee:url-patternType""
                   maxOccurs=""unbounded""/>
]]]

There are three places where the ""jsp-property-group"" element is represented by an object in Tomcat:

a) in Jasper, o.a.jasper.compiler.JspConfig$JspPropertyGroup
b) in Catalina, o.a.catalina.deploy.JspPropertyGroup
c) in Servlet 3.0 API, javax.servlet.descriptor.JspPropertyGroupDescriptor (implemented by o.a.c.core.ApplicationJspPropertyGroupDescriptor)

The implementations in a) and c) are correct ones,  but in b) the collection of url patterns is mistakenly represented by a single value and setUrlPattern() method.

As the ""setUrlPattern"" method is called by digester (configured in o.a.c.startup.WebRuleSet), only the last url-pattern value survives.



The observable consequences of this issue:
===========================================
1. Merged web.xml is reproduced and passed to Jasper incorrectly.

(Currently it is passed only when metadata-complete=""false"" or absent, as I noted in Re:r1371995 on dev@, which is a different issue but it hides the effect of this one).

2. A known feature is that the paths mentioned in jsp-property-group are implicitly mapped to the JspServlet. Due to this issue this mapping occurs only for the last url-pattern.
(in WebXml#configureContext())


To reproduce in current 7.0.x (7.0.29 is affected):
====================================================
1. Unpack attached archive and put the files into the ROOT webapp.
The files are context.xml with <Context logEffectiveWebXml=""true""/>
and web.xml without metadata-compete attribute and adding the following:
[[[
  <jsp-config>
    <jsp-property-group>
      <url-pattern>*.foo</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>*.bar</url-pattern>
      <is-xml>true</is-xml>
    </jsp-property-group>
  </jsp-config>
]]]

2. Start Tomcat and look into the ""catalina.`date`.log"" file. The merged web.xml should have been dumped there. Look for the ""jsp-property-group"" element.
Actual result:

[[[
  <jsp-config>
    <jsp-property-group>
      <url-pattern>*.bar</url-pattern>
      <is-xml>true</is-xml>
    </jsp-property-group>
  </jsp-config>
]]]

Expected result: both *.foo and *.bar should be mentioned.

(markt)|Static resources and jsp files under WEB-INF/lib/*.jar!/META-INF/resources are not found|"Created attachment 29283 [details]
Example

Hi,

According to Servlet Specification, Servlet container should serve static resources and jsp files, located in META-INF/resources in any jar file under WEB-INF/lib.

""
10.5  Directory Structure
A Web application exists as a structured hierarchy of directories. The root of this hierarchy serves as the document root for files that are part of the application. For example, for a Web application with the context path /catalog in a Web container, the index.html file at the base of the Web application hierarchy or in a JAR file inside WEB-INF/lib that includes the index.html under META-INF/resources directory can be served to satisfy a request from /catalog/index.html. If an index.html is present both in the root context and in the META-INF/resources directory of a JAR file in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the application, then the file that is available in the root context MUST be used.
""

When requesting such static resource/jsp file, Tomcat returns 404 Not Found.

Example is attached.
Request:
http://localhost:8080/test-meta-inf-resources/test.jsp
http://localhost:8080/test-meta-inf-resources/meta_inf_resource.jsp

After investigating the issue I think that the problem is in the following code:
org.apache.catalina.startup.ContextConfig
protected void processResourceJARs(Set<WebXml> fragments) {
...
    if (jar.entryExists(""META-INF/resources/"")) {
        context.addResourceJarUrl(url);
...
}

When I list the entries in jar, I receive:
INFO: Deploying web application archive C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.29\webapps\test-met
a-inf-resources.war
 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
 META-INF/resources/meta_inf_resource.jsp

There is no entry ""META-INF/resources/""

Patch for FileDirContext.java

Weld's TomcatListener is using the recurse method recited below. In the case I am encountering the DirContext that Tomcat provides is a FileDirContext.

The discovery code used by Weld encounters what appears to be a bug in FileDirContext where FileDirContexts for child directories are created with the current FileDirContext's path. This causes an infinite loop while it searches the root directory over and over.

Assuming the class discovery code Weld is using is correct, I tracked down the problem to a specific line in FileDirContext.java.  Fixing this line to set the path of the new child FileDirContext to the matching child directory fixes the issue I am encountering. With this change the project appears to still pass all the unit tests ran with ""ant test"". I have attached the patch to this issue.


Here is Weld's recurse function which I am assuming is correct...

protected static void recurse(DirContext context, Set<String> classes, Set<URL> urls, String prefix) throws Exception {
    if (prefix.length() > 0)
        prefix += ""."";

    NamingEnumeration ne = context.listBindings("""");
    while (ne.hasMoreElements()) {
        Binding next = (Binding) ne.nextElement();
        String name = prefix + next.getName();
        if (name.endsWith("".class"")) {
            classes.add(name.substring(0, name.length() - 6));
            continue;
        }

        Object nextObject = next.getObject();
        if (nextObject instanceof DirContext) {
            recurse((DirContext) nextObject, classes, urls, name);
        }
    }

Note: it was possible for access to be denied when it should have been granted but it was not possible for access to be granted when it should have been denied. (markt)|Nondeterministic behaviour of security constraints|"Created attachment 29303 [details]
test web application that reproduces the issue

I'm experiencing a weird behaviour with certain combinations of security constraints having
the following pattern:
(i) one security constraint applies to (at least) two overlapping URL patterns ending in /*,
where one is more specific than the other (e.g., /a/* and /a/b/*)
(ii) a second security constraint applies only to the less specific URL pattern (e.g. /a/*),
and
(iii) the two security constraints apply to different (possibly overlapping) sets of methods.

One such example is as follows:

<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>test</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
<login-config>
  <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
  <realm-name>test</realm-name>
</login-config>

<security-constraint>
  <web-resource-collection>
    <web-resource-name/>
      <url-pattern>/a/*</url-pattern>
      <url-pattern>/a/b/*</url-pattern>
      <http-method>POST</http-method>
  </web-resource-collection>
</security-constraint>

<security-constraint>
  <web-resource-collection>
    <web-resource-name/>
      <url-pattern>/a/*</url-pattern>
        <http-method>GET</http-method>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint/>
</security-constraint>

The problem occurs for HTTP requests matching to the most specific URL pattern (in the above
example, /a/b, /a/b/c, etc.), but on methods other than the ones mentioned in the first security
constraint (in the above example, GET).

For instance, each time I deploy a web application with the above-mentioned deployment descriptor
in Tomcat, or each time I redeploy it or restart the server in case it is already deployed,
I get randomly either of the two following behaviours:

1) ""GET /a/b"" requests are allowed, i.e. no authentication is required
2) ""GET /a/b"" requests are denied, i.e. the response requires authentication (HTTP 401)

Notice that the behaviour remains then constant until I restart the server or re-deploy the
application. Also, adding arbitrary roles in either of the two auth-constraints, does not
seem to change the result.

According to the Java Servlet Specification, 1) is the correct behaviour. In fact, such requests
shall be allowed to any (possibly unauthenticated) users, because the constraint with the
most specific pattern (the first one) matches to the request, but it does not mention the
method of the request (GET).

I tested several different combinations of security constraints, but this issue seems to occur
only with those of this kind.


Please find attached a WAR that produces the above behaviour.

Here are some HTTP requests I tested together with the expected and actual results:

HTTP Request      Expected HTTP Response    Observed Behaviour
GET /test/a       403                       Always correct

2 nodes running Tomcat 7.0.26
Using a custom session manager, which extends the DeltaManager

My startInternal() method first calls super.startInternal(), then performs a few additional initializations.

I reviewed the code of DeltaManager.startInternal(), and it calls getAllClusterSessions() which in turn calls waitForSendAllSessions(), which requires either getStateTransfered() to return true, or a timeout.

So by this, I should be able to trust that as the second node starts, the initial sync up of all session data from the first node has completed prior to the startInternal() method exiting (and thus prior to my initializations).

This is, however, not the case!  I can confirm this by repeatedly logging the value of findSessions().length during my inializations, and see that number going up!

There appears to be a race condition between the processing of the message containing the actual session data & the ""transfer complete"" message.  After tracing this through a little further, I see the stateTransfered is set to true in the handleALL_SESSION_TRANSFERCOMPLETE() callback method.  And that callback is being called PRIOR to the session data itself even being received!

Here is the debug logging output (slightly scrubbed) which shows this out of order messaging:

http://tomcat.10.n6.nabble.com/tomcat-7-0-29-startup-time-td4984446.html

Mark pointed me at a current EG discussion: 
http://java.net/jira/browse/SERVLET_SPEC-36

The agreed status seems to be that _if_ an <absolute-ordering> element exists in WEB-INF/web.xml, then only the web-fragments mentioned therein shall be scanned. This is especially true if the <absolute-ordering> contains no <others/> element.

An empty <absolute-ordering/> shall therefore disable scanning at all as far as I understood.

This seems already be reflected in servlet-3.0 section 8.2.2 ""Ordering of web.xml and web-fragment.xml"" paragraph 1.d:
""If a discovered ServletContainerInitializer is loaded from an excluded jar, it will be ignored. Excluded jars are not scanned for classes to be handled by any ServletContainerInitializer.""


What I do not yet completely understand is that servlet-3.0 section 8.2.1 ""Modularity of web.xml"" explicitly defines as general rule:

""As before, if the metadata-complete element is set to true in the web.xml descriptor, annotations in the class files and web-fragments bundled in jars will not be processed.""

This not only contradicts the 'clarification' of the EG regarding the ServletContextInitializer which is in question here, but also could be interpreted as : ""if metadata-complete is true, then no web-fragment handling is done. Thus also no <absolute-ordering> will be evaluated"".
Not that I would like this, I just like to have this clarified upfront (before we have to throw away some work afterwards).

(markt)|JVM crash at startup if TC-Native version is too old|"For each Tomcat release there exists minimum version of Tomcat-Native library with which it can work.

Tomcat 7.0.28 requires Tomcat-Native 1.1.24 or later.

If you try to start it with an older version of the library + it is explicitly configured it to use the ""Apr"" variant of a connector,
then it crashes the JVM at startup.

Actual result:
Tomcat will not start and will crash the JVM.
A crash report file is created by JVM (hs_err_pidNNNN.log)

Expected result:
1. Log an error and do not initialize the connector. Do not initialize the endpoint.

If org.apache.catalina.startup.EXIT_ON_INIT_FAILURE=true system property is configured [1], then exit Tomcat.
If the property is not defined or is false (its current default value), then continue with startup sequence, without that connector.


[1] http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/systemprops.html

---------------------
Steps to reproduce: (on Windows)
1. Place an older version of tcnative-1.dll (e.g. the one from Tomcat 7.0.27) into the bin directory.
2. Configure connector with one of these:
protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol""
protocol=""org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpAprProtocol""
3. Start Tomcat
Actual result: JVM crashes, as described above.

---------------------
Notes on the code:
1. The issue is that AprLifecycleListener.isAprAvailable() flag is only tested by Connector#setProtocol(String) and influences autoselection of protocols.

If an Apr protocol implementation is configured explicitly, it does not prevent it from starting.

2. The code is essentially the same in 6.0 and 5.5. So it is an old issue.

This issue happens when running the testsuite because the testsuite explicitly selects the Apr connector.

3. If tc-native version is below required one, AprLifecycleListener shuts down the library by calling terminateAPR().

That is why an old library crashes early.

4. AprEndpoint is not supposed to call AprLifecycleListener.isAprAvailable() directly, because they belong to different subsystems (coyote, tomcat.util.net vs. catalina.core).  Do we care?

We can do the isAprAvailable() check in Connector class, but it would mean that Connector class should know which ProtocolHandler implementations require the library. It could guess it from ProtocolHandler class name (contains(""Apr"")), but it is not pretty.

Note, that simply rethrowing it in JspFactoryImpl.internalGetPageContext() will not help, as will be further swallowed by Java code of JSP page and proper error handling there does not happen without a PageContext instance - see r1347100 for related fix.

Maybe create PageContext instance and initialize session in two separate calls? So that if session initialization fails, it could be handled by that PageContext instance.

More of an inquiry.  Let me preface by saying we have recently adopted this pool and are very pleased so far.

Currently, Jmx managed resources like ConnectionPool and SlowQueryReportJmx are registered under the same domain (i.e. tomcat.jdbc).  Some users may want to employ an alternate object naming strategy.  With DataSource#createObjectName it is relatively easy to change the ConnectionPool ObjectName (i.e. subclass).  However, with SlowQueryReportJmx, due to a static getObjectName method, it requires overriding additional methods which is less desirable.
It appears that ConnectionPool has a constant POOL_JMX_TYPE_PREFIX.  SlowQueryReportJmx appears to use this but DataSource does not? 

Is there any reason that the SlowQueryReportJmx#getObjectName method is static?
What about registering an object naming strategy with the pool that the various components would use, facilitating consistency?  This would mitigate the need to override just to alter the ObjectName.

Sampe app with sources

If a client extends HttpServlet and desides to override doGet() method, resulting servlet can fail to correctly handle HEAD requests.

This will happen, if client chooses to set Content-Length manually (e.g., to allow content bigger than 2Gb):

  resp.setHeader(""Content-Length"", String.valueOf(12345678900L));

and only writes actual content if it is a GET request (e.g., because it is costly operation).

In such conditions, GET request will have correct ""Content-Length"" header, but HEAD requset will have ""Content-Length"" header with value 0.

(markt)|ChunkedInputFilter is not recycled for servlet 3.0 asynchronous request|"I'm using the standard servlet 3.0 async APIs with tomcat 7.0.22.

        asyncContext.getRequest().getInputStream();
        ... read the input stream

The InputStream returns 0 bytes for the HTTP post with chunking. 

After debugging, I found that the ChunkedInputFilter is reused by org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractInputBuffer. But it has never been recycled (nextRequest()?) before the reuse for another request. As a result, the endChunk flag is always true after the first request. And it always return immediately without reading more from the buffer."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52055
Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.28 (markt)|add|52954|Make DIGEST authentication tolerant of clients (mainly older Android implementations) that do not follow RFC 2617 exactly. (markt)|Allowing for broken android HTTP DIGEST support|"Android's browser has a slightly broken implementation of DIGEST support, causing it to fail authentication against Tomcat.

There are 2 issues here which if bypassed in DigestAuthenticator, allow Android devices to authenticate successfully.

1. nc (nonce-count) is 6 digits instead of 8

nonce-count      = ""nc"" ""="" nc-value
nc-value         = 8LHEX

Fail as per RFC, however:
""The nc-value is the hexadecimal
     count of the number of requests (including the current request)
     that the client has sent with the nonce value in this request.""

So Android is sending a 24 bit number instead of a 32 bit number.

Tomcat is failing auth based on (nc.length() != 8) which means the request must match the RFC, but I can't see anything saying that it's necessary to fail based on a shorter nc-value.

Additionally, if this value wrapped due to being too short (the client would have to send the same nonce 16777216 times in a single request), we'd fail it anyway because of the nc check (count <= info.getCount()).

2. uri is specified as an absolute URI, whereas browsers and examples show it as a relative URI.

However, the RFC specifies this as:
digest-uri       = ""uri"" ""="" digest-uri-value
digest-uri-value = request-uri   ; As specified by HTTP/1.1

But in RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1):

Request-URI    = ""*"" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority
...
""To allow for transition to absoluteURIs in all requests in future
   versions of HTTP, all HTTP/1.1 servers MUST accept the absoluteURI
   form in requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will only generate
   them in requests to proxies.""

So this one is a bit vague as to whether an absolute uri should cause a validation fail.

There is an issue listed here showing similar problems against Apache.
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=21239

---------

I've only listed this as an enhancement, as Tomcat isn't broken here, but I'm interested in opinions:

We could:
1. patch Tomcat to allow the two above situations
2. make the above allowable via a setting in the Realm
3. just continue to block digest auth for all Android devices until they fix the problem.

I confirm that I see fireContainerEvent() calls in many places in StandardSession.

Moreover those are two nested loops:  a loop in StandardSession over array
of context.getApplicationEventListeners(); x copying the list of container listeners inside into array in context.fireContainerEvent().

I cannot confirm reported problem with request attributes - I do not see anything in the code that would send events from that access.

Is it possible to solve it with a ReadWriteLock?
Or it would be better to have a helper class that avoids copying the array over on every access (the said copy-on-write one)?

Issuing a redirect like:

patch that shows the processing of the servlet's superclass injections

Hi folks,

I've been running Tomcat 7.0.26 in a JEE container against the EE6 Web Profile CTS.
In many of the tests there is the following scenario: A servlet 'X' extends a regular class 'Y'. An env-entry element for a field in 'Y' with injection-target-class equal to 'Y' is defined in the app's web.xml. The injection-target-name points to a field that is not annotated.

When the app boots and Tomcat handles the injections for the servlet it processes only those that are defined explicitly for the 'X' servlet's class name, ignoring its superclasses.

I'm attaching a patch I made on top of 7.0.x/trunk that fixed the issue. It's quite small.

I believe Tomcat should respect the injections for the servlet's superclasses. What do you think is the right behavior?

Hi,

In org.apache.catalina.core.DefaultInstanceManager#populateAnnotationsCache, when iterating over methods in a given class, in one of the cases (when injection-target is specified) you validate whether the method is a valid setter method.

Hi,

I have a web application (attached) that specifies env-entry in the web.xml. The env-entry does not specify env-entry-type, but specifies injection-target. When deploying that web application, the exception below is thrown:

Servlet Specification, 14.4 Deployment Descriptor Diagram, describes that use case and how it should be handled:
""
env-entry element
If an injection-target is specified for the environment entry, the enventry-
type may be ommitted or MUST match the type of the injection target. If
no injection-target is specified, the env-entry-type is required.
""


I would like to propose a patch (attached) that solves this issue.

I'm looking forward for your comments.

Thanks
Violeta

To reproduce:
1. Create this simple JSP file, ROOT/test.jsp

[[[

2. Start Tomcat and access the page with Firefox

(markt)|ChunkedInputFilter is not recycled for servlet 3.0 asynchronous request|"I'm using the standard servlet 3.0 async APIs with tomcat 7.0.22.

        asyncContext.getRequest().getInputStream();
        ... read the input stream

The InputStream returns 0 bytes for the HTTP post with chunking. 

After debugging, I found that the ChunkedInputFilter is reused by org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractInputBuffer. But it has never been recycled (nextRequest()?) before the reuse for another request. As a result, the endChunk flag is always true after the first request. And it always return immediately without reading more from the buffer."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52055

(markt)|tomcat asynchronous invocation problem|"Created attachment 28581 [details]
a simple test reproducing the problem

We encountered a problem during asynchronous operations (tomcat7 with servlet 3). 
Description:  
One client continuously sends post requests to the server. On the server side for each request created AsyncContext with timeout 20 seconds:
AsyncContext asyncContext = req.startAsync(req, resp);
      asyncContext.setTimeout(20000);
As expected after approximately 20 sec the requests are completed. Then another client also begins to send requests to the server but in this case they are explicitly completed after 500 milliseconds. Something like this:
AsyncContext asyncContext = req.startAsync(req, resp);
      asyncContext.setTimeout(20000);      
      try {
         Thread.sleep(500);
      } catch (Exception e) {
      }

      asyncContext.complete();

The problem is that after running the second client all requests that are waiting for timeout (from the first client) are stuck and not released (onTimeout method of AsyncEvent is not called) until the second client stops sending requests.
It looks like the problem occurs on Linux but not on Windows.

I attached a simple test that may help to reproduce this issue. The following servlet accepts URL parameter “complete”.
When “complete=1” the request will be completed after 500ms.
Otherwise the request will wait till timeout (20 seconds).
Run client that periodically sends requests to /servlet?complete=0. (I have tested it with 10 parallel threads that run in a loop)
Then run another client that periodically sends requests to /servlet?complete=1 (This client can use only a single thread)
See that the first client does not receive any responses while the second client is running."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53061
Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.28 (markt)|fix|53063|When using an Executor with BIO, use the executor's maxThreads as the default for maxConnections. (markt)|Inconsistency in documentation regarding Connector's maxConnections property|"According to the documentation, the ""maxConnections"" property of a BIO HTTP Connector defaults to the value of ""maxThreads"".

Additionally, the documentation states that if the ""executor"" property is specified, any thread related properties on the Connector will be ignored.  This includes ""maxThreads"".

However, when a BIO HTTP Connector is defined with an executor, the default value for ""maxConnections"" does not take the ""maxThreads"" value from the Executor.  In fact, it appears to take the ""maxThreads"" value from the Connector object, which is supposed to be ignored.

https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html#Standard_Implementation


This can be confirmed with the following test.

1.) Download Tomcat 7.0.27.
2.) Edit ""conf/server.xml"", uncomment the ""tomcatThreadPool"" executor, comment out the default HTTP connector and uncomment the HTTP connector below it that uses the executor.
3.) Start Tomcat and connect with jconsole
4.) Look at the Catalina -> ProtocolHandler -> 8080 -> maxConnections.  It will be set to 200 and not 150 (maxThreads on the executor).
5.) Now, stop Tomcat, edit ""conf/server.xml"", add a ""maxThreads"" attribute to the connector, set the value to 300 and start tomcat.
6.) Examine the Catalina -> ProtocolHandler -> 8080 -> maxConnections property again and it'll be set to 300.


Suggestions:

1.) Update the documentation to indicate that ""maxConnections"" for a BIO HTTP Connector defaults to ""maxThreads"" on the Connector, regardless of the presence of an executor.

2.) Fix the ""maxConnections"" default so that it takes its value from ""maxThreads"" on the executor, when an executor is specified.

My preferences would be for #2."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53063

(markt)|java.nio.BufferOverflowException in AjpAprProcessor.output() when AJP client disconnects|"As reported on the users list [2] (note that I used Tomcat 7.0.27, but Bugzilla seems to have only 7.0.26):

Hi all,

some time ago, I wrote about a BufferOverflowException which I got sporadically on my Tomcat 7.0.21 [1], when using the AJP-APR-Connector.
However, at that time I couldn't reproduce the exception.

When I looked at this again today, I was able to create a client that sends an AJP message and aborts the connection, resulting in the BufferOverflowException in Tomcat. I was using Tomcat 7.0.27 with Tomcat Native 1.1.23, on Oracle JDK 1.7.0_03 and Windows 7 32-bit.


To reproduce,

1. On the server side, create a web application containing a servlet which will generate some random data:

@WebServlet(""/index.html"")
public class MyTestServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
       
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        try {
            response.setContentType(""text/plain"");
            response.setCharacterEncoding(""utf-8"");
            
            byte[] bytesToWrite = {48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57};
            
            // Try to write 1,000,000 bytes to the client.
            try (OutputStream out = response.getOutputStream()) {
                for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
                    out.write(bytesToWrite);
                }
            }
            
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            // Ignore
        }
    }
}

Deploy the application as ROOT, so that the servlet will be reachable at ""/"".
Configure Tomcat to have an AJP-APR connector listening on port 8009.


2. On the client side, create a program like this:

public class AjpTester {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        byte[] ajpPacketBytes = { // JK_AJP13_FORWARD_REQUEST for ""/""

        sout.write(ajpPacketBytes); // request Url ""/""

        // Read between 10,000 and 11,023 bytes, then exit the JVM
        byte[] buf = new byte[1024];
        int read;
        int bytesRead = 0;
        while ((read = sin.read(buf)) > 0) {
            bytesRead += read;
            if (bytesRead >= 10000) {
                System.exit(1);
            }
        }
    }
}

The client will send an JK_AJP13_FORWARD_REQUEST message which requests URL ""/"" and sends ""Connection: keep-alive"" and ""Host: localhost"" headers.

I guess the exception itself is harmless, but it may fill up log files, if clients disconnect frequently while receiving data.
Note that before that exception occurs, a regular ""ClientAbortException:  java.io.IOException: Failed to send AJP message"" is thrown by org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.realWriteBytes(OutputBuffer.java:388).
The exception occurs neither with AJP-BIO nor with AJP-NIO.

patch against trunk

The attached patch disables chunking on if there is a Connection: close header, we're on HTTP 1.1 and there's no Content-Length header.

This helps to implement Server-Sent Events [1]. Server-Sent Event are conceptually similar to the forever streaming iframe in the sense that there's an ""infinite"" response from the server that always gets updated. But they're easier to use and with less issues. They are also easier to use than WebSockets if you don't need a back channel.

The specification reccoments to disable chunking. Jetty implements the same behavior, when there's a Connection: close header it doesn't do chunking.

The following discussion [2] leads me to believe that patches would be welcome. The patch comes with unit tests that verify that there is still chunking happending when there is no Connection: close header.

We've run into a scenario where the JIO Acceptor thread hangs as connections are not counted down properly.

This, as you may imagine, is a fairly hard use case to reproduce into a simple test case. The easiest way to reproduce it is to create the following configuration
    <Executor name=""tomcatThreadPool"" 
              namePrefix=""catalina-exec-""
              maxThreads=""5"" 
              minSpareThreads=""0""

<Connector port=""8080"" 
           protocol=""HTTP/1.1"" executor=""tomcatThreadPool""
           connectionTimeout=""10000""
           redirectPort=""8443"" 
           maxConnections=""30""/>

This reproduces one test case, where the state machine is not taking into account that connections may be rejected by the queue, but it doesn't count down the latch.
I'm attaching a patch to fix this specific use case, but it may not be a complete fix. As a workaround, the patch also introduces the maxConnections=""-1"" configuration that disables the usage of maxConnections. The -1 setting is important to give administrator a workaround while the other edge cases are tracked down.

simple webapp with one jsp and one class in one jar, reproducing the error

I've had a strange situation getting NoClassDefFoundErrors on a particular jsp
page (which happened to be the index.jsp page). The class it claimed to not
find is a simple session bean class within a jar in the WEB-INF/lib folder. The
strange thing is that it gave this error only when this page was the first one
accessed after a tomcat restart. If any page was accessed before it, it would
work properly. But if this page was accessed first, then no matter what pages
were later accessed, the error remained in place. So the error/success state
was determined by whichever page was accessed first ater the tomcat restart,
and remained in the same error/success state for as long as tomcat was up,
regardless of anything happening later on (until the next restart)

This seems to be some sort of class-loading oder-of-initialization bug, but is
entirely consistent when the pages are accessed in this order after a tomcat
restart. It drove me nuts for a while, since the main application page was
showing an error after every restart, but I eventually stumbled on a strange
workaround: changing the order or a couple of lines in the jsp, involving the
useBean directive and access to java's URI class. with the order changed, the
error never happens. with the order returned, the error is reproduced as
described above.

I've managed to distill a simple scenario which reproduces this error - a short
jsp and a trivial bean session class - attached. I reproduced this on a fresh
installation of Kubuntu 9.10 in a virtual machine, with sun jre 6 and tomcat6
installed. I didn't change any configuration, just replaced the ROOT sample
webapp with this one, restarted tomcat, and browsed to
http://localhost:8080/index.jsp. Remember u have to restart tomcat after every
change to the jsp if u want to recreate the bug, because simply changing it and
refreshing the browser will always succeed."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48097#c7

<tomcat6:jasper ... />

This does nothing. And by “nothing” I mean that I use `ant -verbose` when running Ant, verbose=”1” within the Jasper task, and there’s no output from the Jasper task, not a single line of output/logging, and the build completes in 0 seconds with no compiled JSPs output.

However, if I define the Jasper task explicitly, using the exact same paths (as you can clearly see):

The jasper task should support namespaces like the other Tomcat Ant tasks, and like other Ant tasks in general.

Source code and example web.xml

Years ago I contributed an enhancement to convert the SSIServlet into a filter (java/org/apache/catalina/ssi/SSIFilter.java).  Now I'm back to offer up some enhancements to the CompressionFilter example (webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/compressionFilters).

I've found (as have others) that the connector compression is flaky and unreliable, so I turned to the CompressionFilter example, but found it to be badly lacking in functionality.  No doubt owing to its status as an example project.  I've made a bunch of enhancements to it and I feel it's worth of being moved out of examples now.  You may even want to deprecate the connector compression in favor of this - or at least roll the two together.  In my own webapp (and the attached zip) I've renamed it to GZipFilter and it lives in my own internal package structure, but please move it back into an org.apache package structure and rename it as you see fit.

The enhancements I've made are:
* It now supports specifying which mime types are compressible.
* It now supports a variable sized buffer, which can be used to avoid chunking on small files.
* The compression threshold and all other settings are configurable in web.xml.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes.

If you adopt these enhancements, please credit David Becker with no email, same as on the SSIServlet.

Web applications|Tomcat 7.0.28 (markt)|fix|52853|Clarify how Jar Scanner handles directories. (markt)|@HandlesTypes not resolving classes when added as repository directory|"I am running an embedded container that loads the web application classes and external JARS using the method WebappLoader#addRepository(java.lang.String). One of the external JARs is spring-web with version 3.1. That JAR file provides the class SpringServletContainerInitializer annotated with @HandlesTypes to load implementations of WebApplicationInitializer for web apps that don't provide a web.xml.

In my application I provide an implementation of WebApplicationInitializer. This is found if I add my compiled class files as JAR file using WebappLoader#addRepository(java.lang.String) - the web application gets configured correctly. However, adding the classes directory instead will not resolve the class. This sounds like some kind of class loading issue to me.

As a side-note the web application is loaded just fine when you provide a web.xml (Servlet compatibility < 3.0). All classes can be resolved and used.

Hi,

In the error message returned in the error page, it is not specified the full composite name that Tomcat tries to lookup, but only the first part (the context) (see incorrect.png).

- Most of the detection and fixing code has been tested ONLY on Sun JVMs. A lot of  the reflection based code does not work with the IBM JDK. 
- Tests in tomcat7.source\test\org\apache\catalina\loader do not seem to run successfully and are incomplete for all the protection that Tomcat provides for classloader memory leaks.
- For some categories of threadlocal memory leaks the key and value are not displayed correctly in the warning messages; particularly ones dealing with indirect references to threadlocals
-  org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadedByThisOrChild(Object) incorrectly traverses the object classloader hierarchy instead of the current (this) classloader hierarchy

Problem Conclusion - 
--------------------
- After extensive testing with the IBM JDKs, I have cleaned up and sanitized some of the reflection code to stop executors, timers, threads etc on the IBM JDK
- Added new tests for detecting threadlocal leaks and thread leaks
- Better ThreadLocal leak reporting with corrected loadedByThisOrChild method and addition of expungeStaleEntries method
- Make code more resilient in certain leak detection scenarios."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52850

Based on a patch provided by Neale Rudd. (markt)|Unlike BASIC Authentication, DIGEST mode does not work if the hash is stored in uppercase.|"Created attachment 28487 [details]
patch against the current 8.0.0-dev trunk adding toLowerCase on hash retrieval

Unlike BASIC Authentication, DIGEST mode does not work if the hash is stored in uppercase.

This is not a problem if the hashes are generated by CATALINA/bin/digest.sh, but if they are prepared with other software which generate uppercase hex strings for hashes, it can be very confusing trying to figure out why digest authentication is not working.

The other hash comparisons use equalsIgnoreCase() to compare the hashes, but the digest version of RealmBase.authenticate() prepares the serverDigestValue by taking the Principal's hash (as is) and prepending it to the nonce and other digest fields, and then rehashing.

As a result, the final hash serverDigest is not the same as the clientDigest value that comes from the browser.

To test, change an MD5 DIGEST hash to upper case and attempt to authenticate.

The provided one-line patch against the current 8.0.0-dev trunk simply uses toLowerCase on the retrieved server-side hash.

Patch proposal

Hi,

I have a web application (attached) that has a Servlet with an annotated (@Resource) field and an annotated (@Resource) method.

When I request the Servlet I'm receiving:

javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Name test.TestServlet is not bound in this Context
  org.apache.naming.NamingContext.lookup(NamingContext.java:820)
  org.apache.naming.NamingContext.lookup(NamingContext.java:168)
  org.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.invoke(AuthenticatorBase.java:472)
  org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:98)


I searched the sources and found that org.apache.catalina.startup.WebAnnotationSet processes and prepares for binding only @Resource annotation on a class level. However org.apache.catalina.core.DefaultInstanceManager tries to process @Resource annotation on field/method level and to inject the necessary Object. Unfortunately as the information is not processed and bound in the naming previously, NameNotFoundException is thrown.

I would like to propose a patch (attached).

I'm looking forward to your comments.

Thanks in advance.

Regards
Violeta Georgieva


Steps to reproduce the issue:

1. Deploy the attached web application
2. Request http://localhost:8080/test/TestServlet
3. NameNotFoundException is thrown
4. Apply the patch and restart Tomcat
5. Request http://localhost:8080/test/TestServlet
6. You should see in the browser ""Annotated field: test Annotated method: test1"""|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52974

The client shutdowns the socket, thus making connection half-closed, and disappears (is blocked by firewall in case of this script). This results in a high CPU load:
Servers polls the socket descriptor for both reading and writing, and gets EPOLLIN event on this half-closed connection, then it is trying to write, failing with EAGAIN, polling sd for writing and reading events again, getting EPOLLIN, trying to write... and so on, as you can see from the attached strace snippet:

The interface in question is org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.env.ICompilationUnit which resides in an internal package and should not be implemented by clients. The ideal resolution to this problem would be for Jasper to discontinue implementing it, but we would also be fine with Jasper just updating their code to resolve the compilation problems."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52758

if uriRoot is not null,
it scans all jsp files under uriRoot,

It should be more desirable to check if uriRoot is a directory or not first and then scanning it.


Here are my suggestion.

Jasper|Tomcat 7.0.27 (markt)|fix|52776|Refactor the code so JspFragment.invoke cleans up after itself. Patch provided by Karl von Randow. (markt)|Generator's JspFragment.invoke implementation does not reset ELContext[JspContext.class]|"If a developer captures a JspFragment themselves and calls invoke on it, the JspContext.class attribute in the enclosing pageContext's ELContext is set by the generated JspFragment subclass, but not reset to its original value afterwards. Therefore after invoking a JspContext any EL expressions will be searching the wrong jspContext for attribute values.

org.apache.jasper.compiler.Generator is responsible for creating the JspFragment subclass to represent the compiled fragment. The generatePostamble() method emits generated code to set the JspContext attribute in the ELContext:

out.printil(""this.jspContext.getELContext().putContext(javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext.class,this.jspContext);"");

However it doesn't later put back the original value.

If you are using the <jsp:invoke> tag to invoke the fragment (which is undoubtedly what most people are doing) then the code generated by visit(Node.InvokeAction n) in Generator explicitly restores the EL context:

out.printil(""jspContext.getELContext().putContext(javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext.class,getJspContext());"");

However if you call invoke(Writer) on the JspFragment yourself you don't get that tidy up code.

I suggest the resolution is to have the JspFragment.invoke method tidy up after itself. It ""puts"" the change to the JspContext.class attribute so it should also re""put"" it. Then there shouldn't be any need to restore the EL context in the generated <jsp:invoke> code.

I have tested this solution successfully."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52776

2. It hits javax.el.BeanELResolver#invoke() the most, as ExpressionFactory.newInstance() is called on each invocation.

Jasper|Tomcat 7.0.27 (markt)|fix|53001|Revert the fix for 46915 since the use case described in the bug is invalid since it breaks the EL specification. (markt)|Behaviour of ResourceBundleELResolver|"I have discovered the the ResourceBundleELResolver from the tomcat el-api.jar behaves differently then the one from standard el-api.

The difference lays in the handling of missing properties. The tomcat version will not set the resolved property to true such that evaluation continues and finally an exception is thrown. This causes pages to crash if a property can not be found (which I think is kind of unacceptable for production sites).

The bahaviour was changed due to https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46915.

I think that changing the standard behaviour of ""resolving"" an unbound property by just returning its key is to throwing an exception was a strong decision. I would strongly recommend of reintroducing the old bahviour and fixing the issue 46915 in a different way. If someone can point my to the requirements and corner cases related to 46915, I will gladly provide an implementation.

Until then, a workaround for everybody using jsf: Subclass the ResourceBundleELResolver and override its getValue(...) method. Change it such that it sets the PropertyResolved attribute to true before any exception might occur.

The documentation mentioned the JMXProxy interface should remain the same
during this upgrade so we are a little confused with the exceptions.  To add a
little more detail we have enabled all the new Manager roles while we test this
issue. 

  <role rolename=""admin-gui""/>
  <role rolename=""admin-script""/>

  <role rolename=""manager-gui""/>
  <role rolename=""manager-script""/>
  <role rolename=""manager-jmx""/>
  <role rolename=""manager-status""/>

  <user username=""xxxx"" password=""xxxx""
roles=""admin-gui,admin-script,manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status""/>

Any ideas?

Patch to create new test case and fix to make it work

Closing a connection returns the connection to the pool but does not clear its handler (the JDBC interceptor chain).  As a result, the next request for a connection may re-open and return the old handler.

This behavior breaks multi-threaded code which closes a connection twice.  The exact behavior being that thread 1 closes a connection, thread 2 opens a new connection and gets the exact same connection object as thread 1, thread 1 then closes is connection a second time thereby breaking thread 2.

I'm attaching a patch with a new test case which fails against the current revision as well as a fix for ConnectionPool."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52002

The line marked '//clear the flag, and bail out' is wrong, because after that there is no way for calling code to find out that the thread has been interrupted.

The correct behavior should be

    Thread.currentThread( ).interrupt( );

Here is the excerpt from the Biran Goetz's ""Java Concurrency in Practice"" chapter 5.4.

<!START QUOTATION>
For library code there are basically two choices:

-- Propagate the InterruptedException. This is often the most sensible policy if you can get away with it -- just propagate the InterruptedException to your caller.  This could involve not catching InterruptedException, or catching it and throwing it again after performing some brief activity-specific cleanup. 

-- Restore the interrupt. Sometimes you cannot throw InterruptedException, for instance when your code is part of a Runnable. In these situations, you must catch InterruptedException and restore the interrupted status by calling interrupt on the current thread, so that code higher up the call stack can see that an interrupt was issued.
<!END QUOTATION>

In the case of borrowConnection, #1 is not really a choice, as it is running in the confines of JDBC interface.  But it can definitely restore the interrupt status of the thread."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52066

(markt)|Response output written in filter can be truncated|"Due to changes 1229726, 1229727 and 1229728 output written to response in the filter can be truncated up to 8192 bytes. Consider the following scenario:

- you have a filter that invoke getWriter() before chain.doFilter(request, responseWrapper)


- responseWrapper overrides getWriter() method and returns some
  buffered writer, not the real one


- during execution of chain.doFilter there is a forward


Before the forward ApplicationDispather calls resetBuffer on response, which in turn calls reset() on OutputBuffer, which sets gotEnc field to false. This field is initialized in the setConverter() method which is called from response.getWriter(), but since our wrapperResponse overrides getWriter(), OutputBuffer.setConverter() never called and OutputBuffer still has gotEnc = false.


Response's close() and flushBuffer() methods call OutputBuffer's flush(), but since gotEnc == false, conv.flushBuffer() is not called:


if (gotEnc && conv != null) {
    conv.flushBuffer();
}


A workaround for us is to implement getWriter() method in responseWrapper like this:


public Writer getWriter() {
  Writer originalWriter = originalResponse.getWriter();//save for future processing
  return ourWriter;
}


Maybe you should change flushing to something like that:


if (conv != null) {
    conv.flushBuffer();
}


because you invoke conv.convert() without any checks in the write*() methods and it seems like conv is never null."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52577
Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.26 (markt)|fix|52586|Remove an old and now unnecessary hack that modified the path info reported via the javax.servlet.forward.path_info request attribute when forwarding to an error page. (markt)|When requests are forwarded, the request attribute javax.servlet.forward.path_info is assigned an incorrect value.|"As per the servlet spec, the values for:

javax.servlet.forward.request_uri
javax.servlet.forward.context
javax.servlet.forward.servlet_path
javax.servlet.forward.path_info
javax.servlet.forward.query_string

MUST be set to the values from the very first servlet that serviced the current request.  However, it seems that Tomcat is populating path_info with the value of the LAST path_info serviced in the request (i.e. the final servlet that serviced the request).  It's possible the other value assignments are afflicted by similar defects, I've not explicitly tested for this.

Because of this issue, it's impossible to correctly reconstruct the original request's URI piecemeal by concatenating context+servlet_path+path_info+?+query_string, since path_info will contain the path to another servlet and thus this concatenation will produce a probably invalid URI target.

Therefore, creating ""click here to retry"" links is impossible without workaround code.

As a result of the mail thread [1] I'm opening a bug.

In short it is not clear how exactly ""Dependencies on extensions"" mechanism can be used.

I have two proposals:

1. Tomcat can continue to use in its implementation a separate property (""catalina.ext.dirs"") that provides extensions' location. But its value should be added by default to the Tomcat's classpath directories (e.g. ""shared.loader"").
- Pros: Tomcat users will know that this property specifies the directory for their extensions and only the files located there will be scanned during ExtensionValidator.validateApplication invocation.
- Cons: Additional configuration that has to be maintained.

2. Tomcat can remove this separate property (""catalina.ext.dirs"") and start searching for such extensions in the Tomcat's classpath directories (e.g. shared.loader).
- Pros: No additional configuration is needed. One can specify the shared libraries and the extensions with one and the same property.
- Cons: During ExtensionValidator.validateApplication, it may appear that a lot of files are scanned which might be not necessary.

I'm willing to provide a patch once we agree on the solution. My favourite is the first proposal.

I'm looking forward to your comments.
Thanks in advance.

Annotation processing for Servlets/Listeners/Filters is skipped when:
- the web app is not extracted (screenshot1), 
- classes do not have packages (screenshot2),
- for some embedded scenarios (running Tomcat in OSGI environment - screenshot3)

A test web application is attached - test-web-app.war.

I followed the history and the change that introduces that behaviour is made with revision 1210012.



org.apache.catalina.startup.ContextConfig

The annotations are processed correctly in all use cases when we have:

1199    URL webinfClasses;
1200    try {
1201        webinfClasses = context.getServletContext().getResource(
1202                                ""/WEB-INF/classes"");

The way how they are processed now is assuming that we will have FirDirContext always.

1196    try {
1197        NamingEnumeration<Binding> listBindings =
1198                    context.getResources().listBindings(""/WEB-INF/classes"");

(markt)|Space in username not properly escaped in log files (%u)|"Spaces, if any, in a username are not being properly escaped when they are written to logs (as part of %u). The normal logs use space as a delimiter between field, so have an unescaped space screws up all log processing for anything involving usernames (%u) with spaces.

This is ESPECIALLY a problem for user SSL certificates, because organizations (O=) typically include a space character, e.g., ""U.S. Government"".  Even the Apache docs show an organization ""O="" with a space in: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/ssl_howto.html.  Thus, if usernames are actually user SSL certificates, then anyone with an organization having a space in it (including U.S. Government"") will have a corrupted log entry.

Note that the DEFAULT log format includes %u.

This is NOT the same as bug 28117, because this involves whitespace not backslashes.

Here's an example of the format I see in the log files:
1.2.3.4 ""-"" /C=US/O=U.S. Government/OU=DoD/OU=PKI/OU=CONTRACTOR/CN=someNAME.someNUMBER [22/Jul/2011:14:56:50 -0400] ""GET /somestuff HTTP/1.1"" 200 4319
Notice that ""U.S. Government"" has an embedded space.  But a leading ""/"" doesn't tell anyone where it begins or ends.

I don't know which escape mechanism is the right one for usernames.  I can imagine %20 working.  Alternatively, surround it with double-quotes if there's an embedded space, and escape double-quote as a pair of double-quotes inside that.  The key is to pick one.

I have confirmed that this happens in httpd version 2.2.3 of CentOS version 5.6.  I don't know for sure if it happens in later versions, though I suspect it does.  However, I'm seeing this in a production system, and I don't have the luxury of upgrading to latest version of Apache.  I originally found this problem when trying to parse a log using the Apachelog Python library at http://code.google.com/p/apachelog/downloads/list but I don't think the library is at fault here.

Fixes JSP compilation with javac when Tomcat is installed at a path that includes spaces. (markt)|TC7 + AntCompiler problems with whitespace in pathname|"### Overview

Bug opened for Linux but it also happens on Windows - see below for detailed environments.

TC fails to compile JSP when:
    1) the compiler is AntCompiler
and 2) there is a whitespace somewhere in the absolute pathname to TC home dir.

It may also fail when the absolute pathname to TC home dir contains non URI-compatible characters but I have tested only with whitespace.

Configuring logging.properties to have AntCompiler set to level FINEST, logs show that:
- whitespace is translated to ""%20"";
- javac task fails with many errors, the first being ""package javax.servlet does not exist"".

Our tests show that:
- When AntCompiler is used AND tomcat is installed in a directory whose absolute pathname does NOT contain any whitespace, compilation is ok.
- When AntCompiler is used AND tomcat is installed in a directory whose absolute pathname DOES contain at least one whitespace, compilation fails.
- When JDTCompiler is used, compilation is ok (whitespace or not).

This has been tested with the two environments described below (+ steps to reproduce).


### History

Some discussion has hapened on Tomcat mailing list on January 2011 and ""markt at apache.org"" wrote I should fill a bug (my initial mail subject is ""TC7 + AntCompiler problems with whitespace in pathname"", posted January 17th 2011 around midnight, French time zone).

Following ""aw at ice-sa.com""'s advice on the mailing list, I googled with ""deployment"" and found this:
- TC6: In CGI Mode, ""executable"" full path with spaces does not work
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49657
- TC5: Tomcat fails to start on linux if CATALINA_HOME contains a space
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43578
- TC5: java.endorsed.dirs is not used when JSP compilation is forked (see comment #2)
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31257#c2

It looks like having spaces ought to be ok.

Note: on Windows, the installation wizard deploys TC into ""C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation"" which contains many spaces.


### Background

Q: Why not use JDTCompiler?

A: We have at least one ""huge"" JSP that fails to compile with JDTCompiler (""unresolved compilation error""). When we delete code from this JSP, it compiles. We could resolve the problem for this specific JSP but we have not found what makes the boundary between ""it compiles"" and ""it does not compile"" (tried suppressSmap=false, development=false). We can not afford to deploy our application on a production server with a compiler that might ""randomly"" fail on some other JSP. Previous version of our application has always been compiled with Sun / Oracle JDK: we prefer not to change the compiler brand.


### Build & Platform

Test environment #1:
- OS is Linux 32 bits (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS)
- TC is tomcat-7.0.23
- Files ant.jar + ant-launcher.jar from ant-1.8.2 copied to tomcat lib dir
- File tools.jar copied from JDK to tomcat lib dir
- ""javac -version"" returns
    javac 1.6.0_26
- ""java -version"" returns
   java version ""1.6.0_26""
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03)
   Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 20.1-b02, mixed mode, sharing)

Test environment #2:
- OS is Windows 7 64 bits
- TC is tomcat-7.0.23
- Files ant.jar + ant-launcher.jar from ant-1.8.2 copied to tomcat lib dir
- File tools.jar copied from JDK to tomcat lib dir
- ""javac.exe -version"" returns
    javac 1.7.0
- ""java.exe -version"" returns
    java version ""1.7.0""
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0-b147)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0-b17, mixed mode)

Note: same results with Windows 2008 R2

### Steps to reproduce

Each test begins this way:
- Extract apache-tomcat-7.0.23.tar.gz to <SOME_DIR>
- Depending on test <SOME_DIR> absolute pathname contains a space or not
- Download apache-ant-1.8.2-bin.tar.gz
- Extract to any temp directory
- Copy apache-ant-1.8.2/lib/ant.jar + apache-ant-1.8.2/lib/ant-launcher.jar to <SOME_DIR>/lib
- Forget ant (extracted directory can be deleted)
- Copy JDK lib/tools.jar to <SOME_DIR>/lib (mandatory when fork=false, see below)
- Update original web.xml this way (starting at line 230):
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>jsp</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet</servlet-class>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>fork</param-name>
            <param-value>false</param-value> <!-- true: same failure -->
        </init-param>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>xpoweredBy</param-name>
            <param-value>false</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>compiler</param-name>
            <param-value>javac1.6</param-value> <!-- 1.7 if JDK 1.7 is used -->
        </init-param>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>suppressSmap</param-name>
            <param-value>true</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <load-on-startup>3</load-on-startup>
    </servlet>
- Delete <SOME_DIR>/work to be sure not to run with any previous compilation results
- Run tomcat with startup.sh (or startup.bat if running on Windows)
- Go to http://localhost:8080
- When <SOME_DIR> absolute pathname contains a space, it fails, else it works.


### Actual Results

Our tests:
- Env#1, SOME_DIR=""/mnt/DSK2/tmp/tc/tc 7.0.23"" => FAILS
- Env#1, SOME_DIR=""/mnt/DSK2/tmp/tc/apache-tomcat-7.0.23"" => WORKS
- Env#2, SOME_DIR=""C:\Users\ekp\Desktop\Work tc7\apache-tomcat-7.0.23"" => FAILS
- Env#2, SOME_DIR=""C:\tc7\apache-tomcat-7.0.23"" => WORKS


### Expected Results

TC should compile JSP even if the absolute pathname to TC home dir contains a space (or, I suppose, any other non URI-compatible character).

This is especially disturbing on Windows because the TC installer deploys into ""C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation"" which contains many spaces.

Jasper|Tomcat 7.0.26 (markt)|fix|52666|Correct coercion order in EL when processing the equality and inequality operators. (markt)|EL should coerce String to Integer in equals operation|"This issue was reported on the users@ list, thread:
""EL String -> int coercion stopped working after TC 5.5 -> 7.0 upgrade?""

http://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/a7l45meiakblxcvz
http://marc.info/?t=132918931400002&r=1&w=2

Original reporter used <c:out> tag, but it is not necessary to reproduce the issue.

The issue is reproducible in current 7.0 and 6.0. It works correctly in 5.5.35.

To reproduce,
1. save the following JSP page as ROOT/test.jsp
[[[
${param['foo'] == 1}<br>
${1 == param['foo']}<br>
${1 == (0+param['foo'])}<br>
]]]

2. go to http://localhost:8080/test.jsp?foo=01

Expected result:
true
true
true

Actual result:
false
false
true

This happens for foo=01, 001 etc. The equals result happens only when foo=1


According to EL 2.2 specification chapter 1.8.2 the ==,!= operators have the following step: ""If A or B is Byte, Short, Character, Integer, or Long coerce both A and B to Long, apply operator"". This step should happen earlier than coercion to String."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52666

Web applications|Tomcat 7.0.26 (markt)|fix|52515|Make it clear in the Realm how-to in the documentation web application that digested password storage when using DIGEST authentication requires that MD5 digests are used. (markt)|Digest auth specifically requires digested passwords to hashed with MD5|"Re:
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/realm-howto.html#Digested_Passwords


The documentation says:

""If using digested passwords with DIGEST authentication, the cleartext used to generate the digest is different. In the examples above {cleartext-password} must be replaced with {username}:{realm}:{cleartext-password}.""


The documentation does not mention the fact that when using HTTP Digest Auth with digested passwords, you MUST use the MD5 algorithm to digest the passwords.

When the authentication is performed, the digest algorithm specified for the realm is ignored, and MD5 is always used, so if SHA has been used, authentication will fail.


(Would it be appropriate to log a warning if it is detected that Digest Auth is being used and the Realm's digest algorithm is something other than MD5...?)

(""add host alias using jmx doesn't take affect until restart"")

In Mapper#addHostAlias(String name, String alias)
the following line:
   newHost.object = realHost;

should be replaced with the following one:
   newHost.object = realHost.object;

That was r712467 (3 years ago). The issue affects current 5.5.x and 6.0.x as well.

The issue manifests itself only if addAlias() is called on an existing Host in embedded scenario or through JMX. The usual workflow of configuring aliases in server.xml is not affected.



The issue was reported on the dev@ list,
http://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/sskxor4a3xtrjmk3
""Multiple Aliases Problem""

Reproduction recipe #1, as reported on dev@:

<quote>
  I created a Host instance with the localhost1 domain name.

  Host host = new StandardHost();
  host.setAppBase(CATALINA_HOSTS_HOME);
  host.setName(""localhost1"");
  host.setDeployOnStartup(false);
  host.setBackgroundProcessorDelay(5);
  host.setAutoDeploy(false);
  host.setRealm(engine.getRealm());
  engine.addChild(host);

  Then I added the localhost2 as a alias.

  host.addAlias(""localhost2"");

  If I entered localhost1 at a browser then it works fine but if I entered localhost2 at the browser then I got an error:

Nov 21, 2011 1:29:26 PM org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractHttp11Processor process SEVERE: Error processing request java.lang.ClassCastException:

at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngineValve.invoke(StandardEngineValve.java:105) 
</quote>

A workaround for the embedded scenario should be to reorder the calls as following:
  host.addAlias(""localhost2"");
  engine.addChild(host);

That will call Mapper.addHost(String name, String[] aliases, Object host) which processes aliases correctly.


Reproduction recipe #2, using JMX:

1. In standard server.xml replace
 <Engine defaultHost=""localhost"" with <Engine defaultHost=""foohost""
 <Host name=""localhost"" with <Host name=""foohost""
2. Start Tomcat
3. Open http://localhost:8080/  It opens correctly
4. Start JConsole and connect to Tomcat
5. In Catalina -> Host -> foohost -> Operations
call addAlias(localhost)
6. Refresh http://localhost:8080/  Expected result: It opens correctly

ContextConfig.java

It appears that Tomcat is attempting to copy the WAR from the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory to the $CATALINA_HOME/temp directory without the .war extension (e.g., original docBase is $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/example.war and a new docBase of $CATALINA_HOME/temp/1-example ).  I think that line 973 in ContextConfig.java method antiLocking never evaluates correctly because the docBase gets set to the value of path on line 969, which removes the .war extension so the file ends up being $CATALINA_HOME/temp/1-example instead of 1-example.war.  
 
Additionally, applications with sub-context paths (e.g., foo#bar.war) never get deployed to temp correctly with antiResourceLocking=""true"" regardless of the unpackWARs setting because of the above scenario and because the docBase gets set to the context path in the antiLocking method which converts the # separator to /.  There appears to be a fix on line 882 of fixDocBase that converts the / character to # in the path but that doesn't make it to the antiLocking method.

Both 6.0.35 and 7.0.23 exhibit the same behaviour.  In 7.0.23, the docBase is changed back to the context path via the ContextName now instead of the context.getPath() but the result is the same.  Interestingly enough, there is a comment in the 7.0.23 source on line 750 that suggests the code to copy the .war file is never reached and that it's possibly a bug.  This code is never reached because the docBase is changed to the path without the .war extension."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52293

proposed diff to fix org.apache.catalina.authenticator.NonLoginAuthenticator

This problem has been explored and discussed on the tomcat-users mailing list under the title ""SingleSignonValve and webapp session timeout"". Basically, a webapp that does not need to define a <login-config> is valid under the servlet 3.0 spec and therefore should be able to participate in a single signon realm. It should be able to inherit the security principal established by another webapp within the same realm. Its own <session-timeout> value should be honoured, even when all the other sessions in the same SingleSignOnEntry have expired.

The problem is with NonLoginAuthenticator - at some time it had SSO helper logic that was too primitive. This logic was completely commented-out in tomcat 6.0.0.

I have two fairly simple webapps (not quite drop-ins) that demonstrate the problem and my proposed fix. I have heavily commented my proposed fix to explain the surrounding dependent logic that it relies on.

At the moment I have not found an SSO-based unit test for any of the AuthenticatorBase concrete classes, but I will try to create one (eventually)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52303

(markt)|AccessLog does not log size for files sent with sendfile|"Confirming a problem reported on the users@ list.

This affects both NIO and APR protocols when file is delivered with sendfile. Note, that the file have to be >48kb to trigger use of sendfile.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Configure three connectors:
    <Connector port=""8081"" protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol""
               connectionTimeout=""20000""
               redirectPort=""8443"" />
    <Connector port=""8082"" protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol""
               connectionTimeout=""20000""
               redirectPort=""8443"" />
    <Connector port=""8083"" protocol=""org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol""
               connectionTimeout=""20000""
               redirectPort=""8443"" />

and configure AccessLogValve in a <Host>:

        <Valve className=""org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve""
               directory=""logs""
               prefix=""localhost_access_log."" suffix="".txt""
               pattern=""%h %l %u %t &quot;%r&quot; %s %b (%D ms)"" />

The difference from common pattern is that I added ""(%D ms)"" at the end.
 
2) Put some big file (>48k) as webapps/ROOT/file
3) Download it 3 times:
http://localhost:8081/file?8081
http://localhost:8082/file?8082
http://localhost:8083/file?8083
4) Access Log:

127.0.0.1 - - [10/Dec/2011:01:05:08 +0300] ""GET /file?8081 HTTP/1.1"" 200 15027784 (4766 ms)
127.0.0.1 - - [10/Dec/2011:01:05:23 +0300] ""GET /file?8082 HTTP/1.1"" 200 - (31 ms)
127.0.0.1 - - [10/Dec/2011:01:05:48 +0300] ""GET /file?8083 HTTP/1.1"" 200 - (16 ms)

Note that '-' is printed instead of file size for Nio and Apr connectors.

Workarounds:
------------
A). Disable sendfile with useSendfile=""false"" on a connector

B). Add the following pattern to AccessLogValve:

""%{org.apache.tomcat.sendfile.start}r %{org.apache.tomcat.sendfile.end}r""

That will log the range of bytes sent by sendfile.
E.g.:

127.0.0.1 - - [10/Dec/2011:01:05:08 +0300] ""GET /file?8081 HTTP/1.1"" 200 15027784 (4766 ms) - - 
127.0.0.1 - - [10/Dec/2011:01:05:23 +0300] ""GET /file?8082 HTTP/1.1"" 200 - (31 ms) 0 15027784 
127.0.0.1 - - [10/Dec/2011:01:05:48 +0300] ""GET /file?8083 HTTP/1.1"" 200 - (16 ms) 0 15027784 
--------------

Overall, looking at the timing value printed by %D I would say that logging occurs before data are sent. So the value of 0 bytes is correct.

It could be possible to log file size from request attributes set by sendfile, but that cannot account for aborted downloads. Though I think that would be better than the current logging of '0'.

At least this limitation can be mentioned in documentation for %b and %B patterns in AccessLogValve section in valve.html and in Javadoc."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52316
Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.24 (markt)|fix|52326|Reduce log level for class loading errors during @HandlesTypes processing to debug. (markt)|Lower log level for failed class loading|"Reference: https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-8894

Tomcat attempts to load classes when it searches for annotations. These class loading attempts when failed, should be silently ignored. 

If the application attempts to load the classes later, it will receive the actual error. However, when Tomcat prints out the stack trace of this class loading error, it gives the wrong signal. There is actually not anything wrong in the application itself, so a WARN as tomcat logs with a stack trace becomes misleading.

The initial fix would be: ContextConfig.java to drop log level to debug in checkHandleTypes method
       Class<?> clazz = null;
        try {
            clazz = context.getLoader().getClassLoader().loadClass(className);
        } catch (NoClassDefFoundError e) {
            log.debug(sm.getString(""contextConfig.invalidSciHandlesTypes"",
                    className), e);
            return;
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            log.warn(sm.getString(""contextConfig.invalidSciHandlesTypes"",
                    className), e);

                    className), t);

(markt)|Massive garbage production observed when using the response writer|"In our application we used to use Tomcat 5, by writing our content directly to the response writer in our servlet:

Writer w = response.getWriter();
w.append(...)


We have regularly measured performance of our application under stress with multiple simultaneous requests per second.

We recently upgraded to Tomcat 7, and immediately observed a performance degradation of 10% on the request roundtrip on the same machine and the same tests, compared to our application deployed on Tomcat 5.

Profiling with JProfiler showed that we got massive amount of transient objects {{java.nio.HeapCharBuffer}} produced - 400Mb+ within a few minutes.

The way we are writing the response is by multiple statements of {{append}} of small strings or single chars, which used to work properly. For experiment, we wrapped the response writer with a {{BufferedWriter}} with a buffer of 64k. This brought our application's performance back to normal.

We see this as either a:
- anti-pattern usage since Tomcat 6/7, in which case please provide some documentation about that.
- bug in the C2BConverter that is applied per every call to the CoyoteWriter write methods, which generates the garbage buffers per every call.

We know that the response stream has a 8k buffer by default. Nevertheless, this buffer comes after the encoding step and as such it is too late to help with the garbage. Perhaps Tomcat can buffer before it encodes?

Still, so much transient objects for just a pattern of eligible use of the servlet API seems a bug to me."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52328

2012-01-09_trunk_TestTomcat_twoapps.patch

Inspired by this thread on dev@:
http://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/5qxa7gjsaav4ytcd
""problem using default Realm in new unit tests""

The problem is the following:

1. Tomcat.getDefaultRealm() is effectively a factory method for some Realm instance. It creates this Realm once and caches it as Tomcat#defaultRealm

2. Tomcat.addWebapp() method calls ctx.setRealm(defaultRealm); for every Context that it creates. Thus the Realm instance is shared between web applications.

3. When Context starts it calls start() method on the realm. When the above method was used to create several web applications then during the start of the second and later ones the following message is logged:

09.01.2012 19:19:29 org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleBase start
INFO: The start() method was called on component [Realm[Simple]] after start() had already been called. The second call will be ignored.

To reproduce:
1) Apply attached patch to org.apache.catalina.startup.TestTomcat of trunk.
2) Run the test.
3) See the above ""The start() method was called"" message in the logs.


I think there are several ways to resolve this:
a) Do not call start() on the Realm if it is already started, as indicated by Lifecycle.getState()
b) Change Tomcat class to do not share the Realm instance between Contexts. b.1) assign it to the Engine, or
b.2) create a new instance every time.


The a) way may lead to problems when the Context is stopped. It is not clear whether the Realm shall be stopped or not. It it is stopped it will affect another webapp. It may also cause problems with asynchronous start of contexts implemented in 7.0.23+.

The b) way is consistent with what happens when server.xml is parsed."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52443

Jasper|Tomcat 7.0.24 (markt)|fix|52335|Only handle <\% and not \% as escaped in template text. (markt)|Tomcat escapes all the \% in Template Text as %.|"hi,

I noticed that there is a problem at the % escape on Tomcat 5.5.34.

(1)The problem
    The JSP Specification 2.0 says:
    ------
    JSP.1.6 Quoting and Escape Conventions
    → Quoting in Template Text
     　・A literal <% is quoted by <\%
    ------

    But the result of the % escape on Tomcat 5.5.34 is :
    ------
    Not only the \% of <\% is escaped as %.
    All the \% in Template Text is escaped as %.
    ------

    If I want to show \% on the HTML page, it is needed to write \\% in a JSP file.

    The problem  also occurs on Tomcat 5.5.23 or Tomcat7.0.8.
    And it seems that the problem has already occured on Tomcat 5.5.0.

(2)The reason
    The reason of the problem is that the following method is not implemented
    according to JSP Specification.
         ・The class:
                org.apache.jasper.compiler.Parser
         ・The method:
               void parseTemplateText(Node parent)
         ・The part of source:
           ------
           else if (ch == '\\') {
                if (!reader.hasMoreInput()) {
                    ttext.write('\\');
                    break;
                }
                // Look for \% or \$
                // Only recognize \$ if isELIgnored is false
                char next = (char)reader.peekChar();

(markt)|JNDI Lookup Error after a Context is closed|"I was integrating Atomikos into Tomcat to register the transaction manager, and the lookup for the transaction manager works fine in JNDI, unless someone else, looks up a JNDI context and closes it. And subsequent calls to lookup the transaction manager also fails saying java:comp is not found. I went through the code and found the problem at ""org.apache.naming.SelectorContext"". When methods of that class is calls, those are delegated to a Context received through ""getBoundContext()"", which returns a ""org.apache.naming.NamingContext"" object. And these are stored in a map in ContextBindings class. So the getBoundContext checks this cache, and if it's found it returns it or else, create a new object and store it and returns it. So the problem happens, if someone calls ""close()"" in the NamingContext object. Then it's implemented in the following way,

   public void close()
        throws NamingException {
        env.clear();
    }

Which just clears the environment, but it doesn't in no way invalidate that cache in the ContextBindings class to remove its entry. So in the next time also when getBoundContext is called to get the same context, it will return the earlier 'closed' context without creating a new one. And the environment it has would be cleared and subsequent lookups done from that will fail.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.23 (markt)|add|51744|Add an option to the StandardContext that allows exception throwing when an application attempts to modify the associated JNDI context to be disabled. (markt)|JNDI Lookup Error after a Context is closed|"I was integrating Atomikos into Tomcat to register the transaction manager, and the lookup for the transaction manager works fine in JNDI, unless someone else, looks up a JNDI context and closes it. And subsequent calls to lookup the transaction manager also fails saying java:comp is not found. I went through the code and found the problem at ""org.apache.naming.SelectorContext"". When methods of that class is calls, those are delegated to a Context received through ""getBoundContext()"", which returns a ""org.apache.naming.NamingContext"" object. And these are stored in a map in ContextBindings class. So the getBoundContext checks this cache, and if it's found it returns it or else, create a new object and store it and returns it. So the problem happens, if someone calls ""close()"" in the NamingContext object. Then it's implemented in the following way,

   public void close()
        throws NamingException {
        env.clear();
    }

Which just clears the environment, but it doesn't in no way invalidate that cache in the ContextBindings class to remove its entry. So in the next time also when getBoundContext is called to get the same context, it will return the earlier 'closed' context without creating a new one. And the environment it has would be cleared and subsequent lookups done from that will fail. 

So I guess the proper fix would be to remove that context from ContextBinding's cache when its close method is closed.

(markt)|501 Method not implemented with successive POST requests|"Created attachment 25911 [details]
client wire/context log, client code, webapp code

An unexpected HTTP 501 occurs if using HttpComponents with successive POST requests against a simple Tomcat 7 servlet (Form-based POST Authentication is enabled). After a sucessfull authentication, the client requests the same protected resource a few times in a row, but the second request always returns a ""501 Method not implemented"" status. All other requests succeed.

The following communication takes place:
1. Client requests a protected resource; Tomcat returns the login page (HTTP200)
2. Client provides the user credentials and calls the login resource; Tomcat returns a redirect (HTTP302)
3. Client sets the location from the redirect for the next request(identical to URI from #1) and requests it; Tomcat returns the page (HTTP200)
4. Client requests the same resource again; Tomcat returns a HTTP501 - Method not implemented
5. Client requests the same resource again; Tomcat returns the page (HTTP200)
6. Client requests the same resource again; Tomcat returns the page (HTTP200)
7. Client requests the same resource again; Tomcat returns the page (HTTP200)

The access log message regarding the 501 says:
'""testName=testValuePOST /test/secure/ HTTP/1.1"" 501 1278', which may indicate that the entity data and the HTTP-method name somehow got mixed up!? Strangely the HTTP501 does not appear in case of a JSP for the requested resource, only if facing a form-based POST authentication Servlet. The servlet does only implement post and get(which calls the doPost) and returns just a string. The client code should be fine since I already posted this issue on the HTTPComponents mailing list and the data sent over the wire seems to be right. 

I attached the source/bin of the testclient and webapp and also the wire/context log of the client.

How can I provide further helpfull information?"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49779

I'm using Tomcat JMX interface to deploy apps as follows:
1) call MBeanFactory#createStandardContext, where MBeanFactory is ""Catalina:type=MBeanFactory"", with parameters: parent = ""Catalina:type=Host,host=localhost"", path = ""/w1"", docBase = <my path to the app>
2) call <my app>#start, where <my app> is ""Catalina:j2eeType=WebModule,name=//localhost/w1,J2EEApplication=none,J2EEServer=none""

As result, my app _is succesfully deployed (its context is available)_, but nevertheless I see the following exceptions in the server console (full stacktraces are skipped, to be attached next comment):

The exceptions looks strange to me, since I don't understand why Tomcat searches for a context xml file during the jmx deploy.

(markt)|Server incorrectly parses incoming HTTP requests and loses them|"We are developing Comet-based web application with native Tomcat Comet support via Atmosphere framework. We use HTTP streaming for transferring data from our servlet to the client. In our scenario, the user connects to the server with XMLHTTPRequest sending GET. In response, we suspend his connection and then, when needed, send data back to him. When the user opens another browser tab and connects to our web application, our web application should close the connection in the first (previously opened) tab and then suspend and use connection from the second. So, my serlvet detect that another GET is incoming in the same session, finds previous connection and closes it (internally using CometEvent.close()). This works as intended. However, the next HTTP request to the web server is not correctly handled, and in my servlet I receive the strange HttpServletRequest with previous GET query string and duplicate request headers from initial GET and the following request. I traced through the Tomcat code, and noticed, that in org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor.process() request field is usually empty (contains no HTTP method, request headers, etc.) However, after Comet closing this object is not empty and contain previoud HTTP request. Later the request headers are parsed and appended to the fields existed in previous request object. After that, this invalid object is passed to my Servlet.
I suppose, that clearing request object when closing comet event and all assosiated data in Http11NioProcessor.actionInternal() can solve this issue."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51881

Gzip Corruption Repro WAR

This appears to be same issue as posted by Christopher Taylor
Jun 30, 2011 at 8:05 am to Tomcat Users. The subject line has been preserved above.

As mentioned in the post, this seems to have arisen with this issue:
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48738

The change introduced this class: FlushableGZIPOutputStream. When we started using this, we noticed that certain string flush sequences would result in corrupt gzip output. 

The attached WAR provides a repro. The sequence of writes to the output stream that would’ve been done by our server is mimicked in this case using a file system. There are 40 files each representing a flush. URL:

""http://localhost:8080/TomcatBugReportWAR""

I’ve allowed the ‘start’ and ‘end’ request parameters to control to the starting and ending points. I’ve also allowed an ‘append’ request parameter dump anything to the outputstream.

The defaults are 0, 40, and “” for start end and append respectively.

The following query string appears particularly interesting as it seems to be the smallest sequence that causes the corruption and the subsequent string that is appended after the output is the only thing that appears corrupted:

""http://localhost:8080/TomcatBugReportWAR?start=19&end=30&append=something”

It’s also possible to reproduce this using only the FlushableGZIPOutputStream without using Tomcat at all. See attached JAR."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52121

It's quite difficult picking out the valid values from the configuration documentation.  For example, the clientAuth description under

does not make it easy to see that the permissible values are ""true"", ""want"" and ""false"", because the code font is not very different from the normal font.

It would be easier to see the values if they were in bold or otherwise high-lighted.

Rather than add fixed styling within the source XML files, maybe one could take advantage of the XSL processing and replace the <code> entries with some other markup to flag such values, e.g. <entry>true</entry>.

And subsequent calls to lookup the transaction manager also fails saying java:comp is not found. I went through the code and found the problem at ""org.apache.naming.SelectorContext"". When methods of that class is calls, those are delegated to a Context received through ""getBoundContext()"", which returns a ""org.apache.naming.NamingContext"" object. And these are stored in a map in ContextBindings class. So the getBoundContext checks this cache, and if it's found it returns it or else, create a new object and store it and returns it. So the problem happens, if someone calls ""close()"" in the NamingContext object. Then it's implemented in the following way,

   public void close()
        throws NamingException {
        env.clear();
    }

Which just clears the environment, but it doesn't in no way invalidate that cache in the ContextBindings class to remove its entry. So in the next time also when getBoundContext is called to get the same context, it will return the earlier 'closed' context without creating a new one. And the environment it has would be cleared and subsequent lookups done from that will fail. 

So I guess the proper fix would be to remove that context from ContextBinding's cache when its close method is closed.

Sample webapp demonstrating the issue

I use Tomcat 7.0.19, jdk 1.7.0-b147, Ubuntu Linux 11.04.

Steps to reproduce:
1. declare error page for 404 code in web.xml
2. Set location of that page to some servlet (let's call it ErrorServlet)
3. go to any invalid URL in webapp (to cause 404)
4. ErrorServlet is called after requestDestroyed on any registered listener.
This kind of behaviour is not correct in my opinion because it
contradicts to contract of ServletRequestListener.
Also it breaks org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener
if ErrorServlet uses session-scoped beans.

Description of the attached war file:
1. wheleph.RequestContextListener sets a local variable in requestInitialized and resets it in requestDestroyed
2. wheleph.SecondServlet writes to System.out the value of that variable thus showing whether it was called between requestInitialized and requestDestroyed or not. It's registered as 404 handler.
3. To reproduce the bug go to any invalid url (like http://localhost:8080/SpringListenerPOC/abcd) and see the message in log: 
""SecondServlet
in scope: false""

Hmm.

The error page handling is currently at the host level. One could argue
the listeners are being fired in the right place (when processing
enters/leaves the context). However, custom error pages defined by the
web app are currently outside the listener calls and that doesn't seem
right.

Addressing this would mean either:
a) moving the error handling to the context (inside the calls to the
ServletRequestListener) or
b) moving the calls to ServletRequestListener to the host level

I am leaning towards a) but wondering why things are the way the are
currently.

I'd suggest leaving this on the dev list for other folks to comment and
then add it to BZ in a couple of days unless the consensus is that it is
not a bug. The next 7.0.x release won;t be until early Sept so there is
plenty of time to get this right.

This just feels like the right state management level to me. Certainly
the default error handler can be called just as easily from this level
of the code.

What happens is that there is a race condition upon waking up the Selector that can cause a SelectionKey to not be marked with InterestOps.READ as soon as it could.  The race is on Poller.wakeupCounter.  These steps can occur which causes my SelectionKey to not have its interest ops reset soon and the Selector to not have wakeup() called on it.

1. Poller0 - Starts processing its run loop and calls events().
2. Poller0 - Checks the wakeupCounter.get() > 0 which evaluates to false (wakeupCounter is 0).
3. Worker1 - Finishes an event and calls in to Poller#addEvent
4. Worker1 - Enqueues the PollerEvent that will reset the interest ops.
5. Worker1 - Calls wakeupCounter.incrementAndGet to increment and get wakeupCounter to 1.  This fails the check to call selector.wakeup();
6. Poller0 - Calls wakeupCounter.set(-1)
7. Poller0 - Calls selector.select(selectorTimeout) and blocks for either the full time out or until another unrelated SelectionKey is polled.
8. Poller0 - Ultimately gets around to calling events() again which now resets the interest ops for the SelectionKey that was processed by Worker1.

The simple fix for this is to change this code:
                            if (wakeupCounter.get() > 0) {
                                //if we are here, means we have other stuff to do
                                //do a non blocking select
                                keyCount = selector.selectNow();
                            } else {
                                wakeupCounter.set(-1);
                                keyCount = selector.select(selectorTimeout);
                            }

As you see, the property name is misspelled (""sslImplemenation"").

When I set the connector property as:
sslImplemenationName=""ru.yamoney.calypso.server.security.jsse.CalypsoSSLImplementation""

the catalina starts fine.

When user connects to https://, the SSL handshake fails with error:

If we have same connector settings,  but if we change it to BIO: Connector=""...Http11Protocol"", everything works fine.

The problem cause is a differences in SSL behavior between BIO and NIO handshake.
I've found the workaround here:
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6448723


See the org.apache.tomcat.util.net.jsse.JSSESocketFactory. JSSEKeyManager wraps the KeyManager.
In NIO mode, the KeyManager should have two extra methods:

        public java.lang.String chooseEngineClientAlias(java.lang.String[] keyType, java.security.Principal[] issuers, javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine engine);

        public java.lang.String chooseEngineServerAlias(java.lang.String keyType, java.security.Principal[] issuers, javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine engine);

We use a custom hand-made SSLInmplemention with extra features:
* Keypair storage on hardware device or database
* ExtendedKeyUsage verification in TrustManager
* CRL validation on CRL distribution point online synchronization
* ActiveDirectory account lookup by certificate

In any event, code that already resides in BeanELResolver should certainly function properly, and mixing a given ExpressionFactory implementation with any conforming API implementation should AFAICT be feasible.

Example Maven project to reproduce the problem

clearReferencesJdbc seems to be causing reference leaks when used with com.oracle.ojdbc5 version 11.1.0.7.0, even if that class isn't loaded by the application.  As best as I can tell, that function is loading one or more classes from the jar.  Those classes are then adding a jmx MBean which then causes a reference leak.

2) Deploy the project to tomcat.
3) Undeploy the project from tomcat.  You should get the error about clearReferencesJdbc


Expected:
While I would expect Tomcat to not leak the class, I would be happy if there was an option to make Tomcat not run clearReferencesJdbc, allowing me to undeploy the app without leaking.  This would not be as much of a problem if it wasn't causing the entire classloader and everything that implies to be leaked too."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51640

I would have expected the application to be available in the URI a/b. The bug seems to be in the ""list()"" method ""of DirContextURLConnection.java. The method assumes that context name does not have any ""/"" characters in it. See the developer note just before the ""if"" block. I have added the ""else if"" condition that seems to have solved the problem for me.

Sample webapp demonstrating the issue

I use Tomcat 7.0.19, jdk 1.7.0-b147, Ubuntu Linux 11.04.

Steps to reproduce:
1. declare error page for 404 code in web.xml
2. Set location of that page to some servlet (let's call it ErrorServlet)
3. go to any invalid URL in webapp (to cause 404)
4. ErrorServlet is called after requestDestroyed on any registered listener.
This kind of behaviour is not correct in my opinion because it
contradicts to contract of ServletRequestListener.
Also it breaks org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener
if ErrorServlet uses session-scoped beans.

Description of the attached war file:
1. wheleph.RequestContextListener sets a local variable in requestInitialized and resets it in requestDestroyed
2. wheleph.SecondServlet writes to System.out the value of that variable thus showing whether it was called between requestInitialized and requestDestroyed or not. It's registered as 404 handler.
3. To reproduce the bug go to any invalid url (like http://localhost:8080/SpringListenerPOC/abcd) and see the message in log: 
""SecondServlet
in scope: false""

Hmm.

The error page handling is currently at the host level. One could argue
the listeners are being fired in the right place (when processing
enters/leaves the context). However, custom error pages defined by the
web app are currently outside the listener calls and that doesn't seem
right.

Addressing this would mean either:
a) moving the error handling to the context (inside the calls to the
ServletRequestListener) or
b) moving the calls to ServletRequestListener to the host level

I am leaning towards a) but wondering why things are the way the are
currently.

I'd suggest leaving this on the dev list for other folks to comment and
then add it to BZ in a couple of days unless the consensus is that it is
not a bug. The next 7.0.x release won;t be until early Sept so there is
plenty of time to get this right.

This just feels like the right state management level to me. Certainly
the default error handler can be called just as easily from this level
of the code.

Ok, what's this about?

In ""protected String[] filterAppPaths(String[] unfilteredAppPaths)""
the exception is raised at

  for (String appPath : unfilteredAppPaths)

Which means the ""unfilteredAppPaths"" passed in is null. filterAppPaths does not check for that (shouldn't there be an assertion at least)

The problems comes from ""deployApps()"":

    protected void deployApps() {

        File appBase = appBase();
        File configBase = configBase();
        String[] filteredAppPaths = filterAppPaths(appBase.list()); <----
        // Deploy XML descriptors from configBase
        deployDescriptors(configBase, configBase.list());
        // Deploy WARs, and loop if additional descriptors are found
        deployWARs(appBase, filteredAppPaths);
        // Deploy expanded folders
        deployDirectories(appBase, filteredAppPaths);
        
    }

Where ""appBase.list()"" returns null. This must be because ""appBase"" does not actually denote a directory (A-HA!)

Indeed, the server.xml points to a nonexisting appBase.

Suggesting to add a check to ""deployApps"":

    protected void deployApps() {

        File appBase = appBase();
        File configBase = configBase();

        if (!appBase.exists() || appBase.list()==null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""The appBase "" + appBase + "" does not exist or cannot be listed"");
        }

        String[] filteredAppPaths = filterAppPaths(appBase.list()); <----
        // Deploy XML descriptors from configBase
        deployDescriptors(configBase, configBase.list());
        // Deploy WARs, and loop if additional descriptors are found
        deployWARs(appBase, filteredAppPaths);
        // Deploy expanded folders
        deployDirectories(appBase, filteredAppPaths);

I looked into the code of this function and it makes the following call:

     ctx.addLifecycleListener(new DefaultWebXmlListener());

When i start tomcat, this DefaultWebXmlListener is activated automatically, and always does the following code, so the manager i set for my context gets overriden with this code:

     public static void initWebappDefaults(Context ctx) {
        ...
        // Sessions
        ctx.setManager( new StandardManager());
        ctx.setSessionTimeout(30);
        ...
     }

so when i set a StandardManager programatically, it gets overriden by this code. The workaround i used, is to unregister the DefaultWebXmlListener, and than add my own context.xml specific settings, like a custom manager for deactivating session persistance:

     Context warContext = tomcat.addWebapp(warContextPath, warLocation);
    
     LifecycleListener[] lclisteners = warContext.findLifecycleListeners();
     LifecycleListener defaultWebXMLListener = null;
     for (int i=0; i < lclisteners.length; i++){
       if (lclisteners[i] instanceof DefaultWebXmlListener){
         defaultWebXMLListener = lclisteners[i];
       }
     }
     warContext.removeLifecycleListener(defaultWebXMLListener);
     ...
     StandardManager manager = new StandardManager();
     manager.setPathname(null); // disable session persistance:
     //manager.setPathname(""SESSIONS.ser"");     
     warContext.setCookies(true);
     warContext.setCrossContext(true);
     warContext.setManager(manager);

i think its a bug that using the ""tomcat.addWebapp"" method makes it impossible to set context.xml specific settings programmatically, because they always get overriden by default values at the tomcat start."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51558
Other|Tomcat 7.0.21 (markt)|fix|51704|Make use of File#mkdirs() more robust. (markt)|Dubious use of mkdirs() return code in juli FileHandler|"File#mkdirs() only returns true if the method created the directory itself.

If mkdirs() returns false, it is still possible for the directory to exist.

Thus the code in FileHandler at [1], i.e.


364     // Create the directory if necessary
365 	File dir = new File(directory);
366 	if (!dir.exists() && !dir.mkdirs()) {
367 	    reportError(""Unable to create ["" + dir + ""]"", null,
368 	    ErrorManager.OPEN_FAILURE);
369 	    writer = null;
370 	    return;
371 	}

can generate an error even though the directory now exists.

It would be safer to code the check as follows:

366 	if (!dir.mkdirs() && !dir.exists()) {

There is no need to call dir.exists() before mkdirs() as mkdirs() does that anyway.

There is similar code at [2] and possibly elsewhere in Tomcat, I did not check.

The test case contains two tests.
The first one (on port 8001) succeeded, while the second one (on port 8002) failed with ""Address already in use: JVM_Bind"". This failure to bind to 8002 was unexpected and does not occur during normal run.

While Tomcat was stopping after failed start, the above ""invalid Lifecycle transition"" exception was thrown by MapperListener.


I was testing with BIO connector only, running a single test (test.entry=org.apache.tomcat.util.net.TestXxxEndpoint).

I think that the cause of the startup failure was that I accidentally started two copies of Ant in parallel. In Eclipse it happens if you double-click on ""Run External Tool"" button.



Looking at o.a.catalina.connector.Connector#startInternal(), it does
 - protocolHandler.start();
 - mapperListener.start();

The logs show that protocolHandler.start() call failed. Thus mapperListener.start() was not called.


This second test TestXxxEndpoint.testStartStopBindOnStart() runs with ""bindOnInit"" property of connector set to ""false"". Thus binding failure did not happen in init(), but occurred in start()."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51555

4. Go to web.xml and edit it once again. E.g. re-comment the mapping, or correct the typo.

5. Wait several seconds. Here is an issue:

EXPECTED: The examples webapp should reload successfully.
ACTUAL: Reload fails. The following is printed in the logs:

04.08.2011 8:09:59 org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig checkResources
INFO: Reloading context [/examples]
04.08.2011 8:09:59 org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleBase start
INFO: The start() method was called on component [StandardEngine[Catalina].StandardHost[localhost].StandardContext[/examples]] after start() had already been called. The second call will be ignored.


6. Stop Tomcat. Here is the second issue:

EXPECTED: Successful shutdown
ACTUAL: 
[[[
04.08.2011 8:14:10 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina stop
SEVERE: Catalina.stop

	at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina$CatalinaShutdownHook.run(Catalina.java:847)
]]]

This exception at shutdown happens only if examples webapp was correct when Tomcat started, but was broken afterwards. If it was already broken at startup time, nothing happens.

7. Here is the third issue: when the above happens the shutdown sequence is apparently aborted abnormally.

EXPECTED: ""INFO: Stopping ProtocolHandler [""http-bio-8080""]"" etc. messages
ACTUAL: There are no messages after the ""SEVERE: Catalina.stop"" one that I cited above."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51610
Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.20 (markt)|fix|51614|Avoid calling store.load() and session.expire() twice in PersistentManager when expiring sessions. (kfujino)|PersistentManager loads session from Store and calls session.expire() twice.|"To check whether session is loaded into  memory, StoreBase#processExpires calls findSession(id). 

=====
...
if (manager.findSession(keys[i]) != null) {
    isLoaded = true;
}
...
=====

However, PersistentManager#findSession(id) loads session from Store when there is no session in memory. 
Because session loaded from Store is an invalid session
PersistentManager logs errorlog, calls session.expire(), and deletes session from Store. 

As a result, findSession(id) returns null, and isLoaded becomes false. 
And, session.expire() is called again, and the session is deleted from Store.

If manager is PersistentManager, it is necessary to call PersistentManagerBase#isLoaded(id). 
However, to avoid regression of r1033024, other managers call findSession(id).

Unfortunately, InternalAprInputBuffer throws away the error code on line 798, but I've run it under a debugger and nRead was -70014.

If you look in the source of apr-1.3.8 at include/apr_errno.h, you'll see this is -APR_EOF.

The bug is in the implementation of recvbb at line 892 onwards in tomcat-native-1.1.20-src/jni/native/src/network.c. Specifically, at the end of the function we check for APR_SUCCESS, and assume all other codes are an error, returning -ss. It should also check for EOF (APR_STATUS_IS_EOF), and return zero. (Or at least, InternalAprInputBuffer assumes that a return code of 0 <=> EOF).

Incidentally, apr-1.3.8/include/apr_network_io.h says in its comment on apr_socket_recv() that ""It is possible for both bytes to be received and an APR_EOF or other error to be returned."". This is a lie. All provided implementations of apr_socket_recv return with *len == 0 in case of APR_EOF."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50394

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.20 (markt)|fix|51557|Ignore HTTP headers that do not comply with RFC 2616 and use header names that are not tokens. (markt)|Newline during a http header field name obscures next value|"Created attachment 27314 [details]
Patch to stop CR & LF in the header.

InternalInputBuffer allows newlines in http header field names. As an example:

Foo: Val1
Bar: Val2
MISS
Hup: Val3

This will lead to a field name of 'MISSHup' and not 'Hup'.

Digging into the specs, I think this goes back to RFC 822 which states:

     field-name  =  1*<any CHAR, excluding CTLs, SPACE, and "":"">

and

     CTL         =  <any ASCII control           ; (  0- 37,  0.- 31.)
                     character and DEL>          ; (    177,     127.)

I think this is saying that field-name should not contain CR or LF.

I've attached a patch that stops CR & LF. Two improvements I could see, if there's agreement with this as a bug, are adding a unit test to TestInternalInputBuffer and changing the code so it disallows space and any other ctrl character in the field name."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51557

Page rendering time jumped by an order of magnitude.

Profiling the webapp through Netbeans, we narrowed down the problem to the getJarFile() method inside org.apache.jasper.compiler.ParseController. Screenshots of the Profiler Hotspots and Call Tree from both versions of Tomcat are available here: http://imgur.com/a/ZmeWM

The URL path used to load the JAR file has changed from Tomcat 6. Below are the values as output by the debugger:
Tomcat 6: ""file:/C:/svn/[PATH_TO_PROJECT]/server/target/snapshot/WEB-INF/lib/[OUR_JAR].jar!/""
Tomcat 7: ""jndi:/localhost/snapshot/WEB-INF/lib/[OUR_JAR].jar!/""

A comparison of the getJarFile() methods shows few differences aside from the URL path that could contribute to the problem:
Tomcat 7: org.apache.jasper.compiler.JarURLResource
public JarFile getJarFile() throws IOException {
    URL jarFileUrl = new URL(""jar:"" + jarUrl + ""!/"");
    JarURLConnection conn = (JarURLConnection) jarFileUrl.openConnection();
    conn.setUseCaches(false);
    conn.connect();
    return conn.getJarFile();
}

Tomcat 6: org.apache.japser.compiler.ParserController

The following applies to Tomcat 7.0.18, but I couldn't select that version.

When a request to a Servlet takes a long time to process, and the webapp is redeployed in that time (e.g. by replacing the .war file), the following NPE is thrown in org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invoke():

10.07.2011 03:27:05 org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter service

	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)

This is because ""context"" attribute in StandardContextValve is null at that time.

I could reproduce this behaviour on Windows 7 (32 bit) with Sun/Oracle Java 1.6.0_26, using the Windows x86 binaries of Tomcat 7.0.18 (from http://people.apache.org/~markt/dev/tomcat-7/v7.0.18/) with the included Tomcat Native 1.1.20.


To reproduce:

0) Download and install Tomcat 7.0.18 (I used the windows x86 zip binaries).

1) Create a simple webapp with a servlet, that takes a long time to process requests, e.g. by calling Thread.sleep(). For example, I used:

@WebServlet(""/LongRequest"")
public class LongRequest extends HttpServlet {
	   
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println(""Start..."");
    	out.flush();
        
        try {
            Thread.sleep(20000);
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            out.println(ex.toString());
        }
        
        out.println(""Finished."");
        out.close();
    }
}

2) Package the webapp as "".war"" file, and make two versions of that file.

3) Deploy the first version to Tomcat by copying the .war file into the ""webapps"" directory.

4) Open a browser and make a GET request to the above servlet.

5) Now immediately replace the .war file in the webapp directory with the second version, so that Tomcat will undeploy the old version and deploy the new one.

5) After the request finishes, the NPE is thrown.


I originally observed a NPE in StandardWrapperValve.invoke() with Tomcat 7.0.16 that I reported on the users list [1], which occured when the webapp was redeployed while a servlet was still processing a request. However, I couldn't reproduce the NPE in StandardWrapperValve.invoke(), but in StandardContextValve.invoke().

Three versions of the ""if"" example, including a fix.

See:
  apache-tomcat-7.0.16/webapps/examples/jsp/tagplugin/if.jsp

Small things:
 * Has unclosed font tags and hr tags (old HTML)
 * Has doubled font tags: ""<font <font"" (broken)
 * Uses ""</br>"" sometimes (broken) - should be ""<br/>"" always

Medium thing:
 * The content in the following prints even when it's not working!  E.g., if the jstl.jar is not there!
    <c:if test=""${2>0}"">
        It's true that (2>0)!
    </c:if>
The User Agent simply prints the content of the unknown tag.

Please add after this:
    <br/>
    <c:if test=""${0>2}"">
	  If you see this, then (0>2)! Fail!
    </c:if>


Major things:
 * Must use the old non-XML syntax with .jsp file suffix:
      <%@ taglib uri=""http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"" prefix=""c"" %>
 * The scope for ""theTruth"" should be ""page"" to avoid testing issues.

If the taglib line is removed and the following is added to the <html> tag:
      xmlns:c=""http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core""
then the example does NOT work, even though it might look like it does!
In this case, ""theTruth"" is still set from if.jsp (if scope=""session"") and the contents of the c:if tag still appear, even with no JSTL processing.

To use xmlns:c rather than the taglib line, the developer must
1) Switch to the .jspx file suffix
2) Use the jsp:root element
3) Or configure Tomcat to treat .jsp as XML

The above is not clear, especially when the example appears to work in many cases when it should not.

I have attached:
1) A fixed if.jsp - please use this.
2) An if.jspx version - please include this for contrast.
3) An if-xmlns.jsp version that does NOT work, but appears to work if if.jsp is visited first.  This is to test the example.

(kkolinko)"|Allow system property variables in catalina.properties|"We currently have two hardcoded ""variables"" that we substitute in catalina.properties, ${catalina.base} and ${catalina.home}.  Is there value in expanding this functionality?  Here is my scenario:

I have several apps, app1, app2, etc.  I have a shared lib directory of jars that the apps share.  In addition, the apps may have several instances running in different ""environments"" (prod, QA, dev, etc.), and each environment has a corresponding version of the lib directory.  The Tomcat configs for the apps (catalina.base) are version-controlled.

Now, I want each instance of these apps (catalina.base) to be as portable as possible without having to make a bunch of changes for each environment.  So, I want to be able to copy the app1-prod catalina.base to app1-qa and not have to make a lot of local modifications to catalina.properties and friends to make it work.  My init script knows that app1-qa is a QA instance and needs to point to the lib-qa shared directory.  So, I set a system property in the init script via CATALINA_OPTS: -Dshared.lib.dir=/path/to/lib-qa for QA and -Dshared.lib.dir=/path/to/lib-prod for production.  What I would like to do is use this system property via ${property.name} in my common.loader in catalina.properties.  The result is that the catalina.base files are the exact same from a configuration perspective without a bunch of local modifications.

I have created two proposed patches for this functionality.  Both work well, but each one has the potential for some slightly different behavior, so I would like to hear the thoughts of the developers on each.

--

Proposal A (currently in production use for my environment):

The variable substitution takes place upon retrieval in CatalinaProperties.getProperty(), pulling in the current value of the system property.  This allows other properties defined in catalina.properties to be substituted.  The (potential) downside or risk is that the value of a catalina.property value may change over time if the system properties referenced in its value are changed by the code during the JVM's lifecycle.

--

Proposal B:

The variable substitution takes place in the class initializer, loadProperties().  This means that every call to CatalinaProperties.getProperty() will return the same result, with system property variables replaced with their value at the time the class was loaded.  The downside of this is that properties set in catalina.properties cannot be used in other properties defined in that file, because they may not yet be set based on the order they are returned by the Enumeration.  This could be worked around, but it would probably take another iteration over the properties (not really a big deal)."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50677

It happens because methods of org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapper treat presence of servlet instance as an indicator of the fact that servlet have been initialized, that is not true when addServlet(String, Servlet) is used."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51376

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.17 (markt)|fix|51400|Avoid known bottleneck in JVM when converting between Strings and bytes by always providing a Charset rather than an encoding name. Based on a patch by Dave Engberg. (markt)|"Use of ""new String(byte[] b, String enc)"" hits Sun JVM bottleneck"|"Created attachment 27186 [details]
Patch with optimizations

We're using Tomcat 6 for a high-volume, high-concurrency service (Evernote).  At times, we've seen a performance slowdown within the service, which we've traced to a concurrency flaw within the JVM code that translates named encodings (e.g. ""utf-8"") into Charsets.  This translates into a number of stuck threads trying to convert a byte array to a String or vice versa, ala:

  java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)
       at sun.nio.cs.FastCharsetProvider.charsetForName(Unknown Source)

       at org.apache.catalina.connector.RequestFacade.getHeader(RequestFacade.java:643)

This isn't a true deadlock, since each thread will eventually finish, but it can
significantly affect concurrency if there are a number of threads making heavy use of:
   new String(byte[] b, String encoding)
   String.getBytes()
   String.getBytes(String encoding)

This is, unfortunately, a known bottleneck within the JVM:
http://blog.inuus.com/vox/2008/05/the-mysteries-of-java-character-set-performance.html
http://halfbottle.blogspot.com/2009/07/charset-continued-i-wrote-about.html
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6790402


To avoid this bottleneck in the JVM, we've patched our server to use the explicit Charset object for String encoding rather than the name of the charset, and then added a ConcurrentHashMap<String, Charset> to lookup charsets by encodings.

I've attached a patch with our fixes on 6.0.32

A patch to Tomcat.java as described.

the Tomcat.addWebapp all create a context, set up the default realm, and set up the surrogate global web.xml lifecycle listener. They differ according to allowing more or less specific configuration of the new webapp. At the end, they add the new context to the host.

Once the container is running, the act of calling addChild starts it. Some configuration steps have to precede 'start' -- for example, setting the loader. Thus, in a complex case, the user needs to take more control of the process.

As things are today, this requires subclassing the Tomcat class and then copying code from the four-arg addWebapp.

The patch provided here allows non-subclasses to take complete control of the process. It accomplishes this by providing methods to obtain three things that are otherwise buried in the Tomcat class: the default in-memory realm, the listener that serves as a surrogate global web.xml, and a dummy pathname to allow the listener to work without conflicts.

Given these accessors, a user can simple create a the context (and its ContextConfig) and configure it to their heart's content, and then pass it to the addChild method of a Host."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51418

Our application expects these requests to be processed by the servlet.  The servlet parses the Authorization header and takes appropriate action (possibly redirecting to the login page or allowing the request if the headers contain an acceptible token).  This has worked in older versions of Tomcat.

The relevant part of our web.xml looks like:

Jasper|Tomcat 7.0.17 (markt)|fix|33453|Recompile JSPs if last modified time of the source or any of its dependencies changes either forwards or backwards. Note that this introduces an incompatible change to the code generated for JSPs. Tomcat will automatically re-compile any JSPs and tag files found in the work directory when upgrading from 7.0.16 or earlier to 7.0.17 or later. If you later downgrade from 7.0.17 or later to 7.0.16 or earlier, you must empty the work directory as part of the downgrade process. (markt)|Jasper should recompile JSP files whose datestamps change in either direction (not just newer)|"I've noticed that Tomcat won't recompile a JSP file if the date stamp is changed
to go back in time. This may seem like a strange case, but if you check an older
copy of a JSP page out of version control, it's different, and needs to be
recompiled. The assumption that all changes to a file involve a newer file
datestamp is an invalid one.

I think I found the code that makes this decision, in
org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler, in the isOutDated(boolean) method. The
condition is
        if (targetLastModified < jspRealLastModified)
but it should be
        if (targetLastModified != jspRealLastModified)
in my opinion.

After all, the logic should be that the file has changed, not that it's newer. I
don't think it's reasonable to expect that Jasper check the size and do an MD5
checksum to *really* see if the file has changed. :)

Obviously the workaround is to just to ""touch"" the file but this adds a lot of
overhead (and one more thing to remember), compared to changing a > to a !=."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33453

patch

Steps to reproduce:

(1) Start 3 Tomcat instances that are using BackupManager.

(2) Run 3 HTMLManagers corresponding to each node.

(3) Run web application that has distributable in its web.xml.

(4) Click the link of the number of sessions for this application.

(5) If the displayed session type is Backup, click the link of session id.
And return to sessions list page soon.
Then, the session type change to Primary.

When the session detail page is displayed, getSessionForNameAndId() calls ctxt.getManager().findSession(), and findSession() calls session.get(id).
If the cluster is using BackupManager, ""session"" is instance of LazyReplicatedMap. And LazyReplicatedMap.get() set session type to ""primary"". 

I thought the solutions of this issue.

(A) Not use findSession(). Retrieve session information from local map.
-> see attached patch

Or
(B) Write the note as follows to the sessions list page. 
""If you click the backup type's sessionid, then the type change to primary.""

(markt)|Allow configuration of service name, AJP port, server port.|"I am using Tomcat to deploy a software application. Some customers run Windows and want Tomcat to run servlets.

For this, we use the installer provided on the site. In two situations, the standard installer does not work well enough:

1. The customer wants two installations on the same server, and therefore needs two services. For instance, one for development/test/acceptance and one for production. This can be achieved but requires manual interaction instead of just next, next, enter something finish.
2. The customer installs software for Sonicwall, also based on Tomcat. They include the standard installer and just overwrite any current service name for Tomcat 6 or 7.

To solve these deployment issues, I would like to be able to configure:

* The name and code of the Windows service to be created. For my own installations, I can then use something different of the standard name. That avoids that less intelligent installers hijack the service later, leading to a service request to me.
* The port for AJP and server. Currently, you can enter the HTTP port. That is very handy when for instance IIS is also running on the same machine. But when two Tomcat instances are running, the AJP and server port in a standard installation must also differ.

I have looked into res\tomcat.nsi. It seems to be responsible for the creation of the service and files.

In trunk around line 202 and 306 I see that the service name and display name are currently hardcoded. That would require some form of adaption.

The additional ports can probably be handled by Function configure.

I also saw that stuff is registered in the registry under SOFTWARE\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat\@VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@. That probably would require adaptation too to allow multiple installs without interfering them with each other. I do not know to handle that.

For the two scenarios, I think I can ask one customer to invest some amount of money, because in the long run it would save him the effort to learn administrator to use tomcat*.exe with options such as //ms."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50949

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.16 (markt)|fix|51324|Improve handling of exceptions when flushing the response buffer to ensure that the doFlush flag does not get stuck in the enabled state. Patch provided by Jeremy Norris. (markt)|When OutputBuffer.doFlush gets Exception, doFlush gets stuck to true|"Created attachment 27114 [details]
The line that causes doFlush to be stuck at true if it gets an exception

First time opening a bug, please forgive me if this report isn't perfect!

I recently ran into an issue where OutputBuffer's doFlush gets stuck to true.

In OutputBuffer.doFlush(boolean) it sets doFlush = true, then calls bb.flushBuffer, then sets doFlush = false.

I issue I ran into was bb.flushBuffer eventually calls OutputBuffer.realWriteBytes.  The realWriteBytes eventually calls coyoteResponse.doWrite.  If coyoteResponse.doWrite throws an IOException, then it rethrows a ClientAbortException.

What I am seeing is my client disconnecting early, and causing the doWrite to throw a SocketException of ""Broken pipe"".  That broken pipe causes a ClientAbortException to be thrown. 

When that is thrown, the error is bubbled up and doFlush is stuck as ""true"".  The next time the processor is used, it calls the recycle() method in OutputBuffer. However, the recycle doesn't reset doFlush so its still set to true.

I imagine there are quite a few ways to fix this, but the two obvious ones that come to mind are:

- Have recycle() set doFlush back to false

or 

- Have throw a finally in try/catch/finally in OutputBuffer.doFlush so doFlush is set back to false when an Exception is catch"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51324

haven't seen the problem before, but it seems that at least
one user of vanilla Tomcat has hit the same problem, on Tomcat 6 in 2009 ([1]).

I am raising this bug to get this on the record and perhaps to help identify a pattern of usage that may ultimately lead to a solution.

It is possible that the bug is in the JRE XML processing, of course.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.16 (markt)|fix|51344|Fix problem with Lifecycle re-factoring for deprecated embedded class that prevented events being triggered. (markt)|org.apache.catalina.startup.Embedded overrides Lifecycle incorrectly?|"Not sure if this is a bug or just my mis-coding...

I've been using the Embedded component in Tomcat 6.0.29 for integration testing. Something like this:

    server = new EmbeddedTomcat(""/test"", 7890, ""JVM-1"");
    PeerToPeerCacheLifecycleListener p2pListener = new PeerToPeerCacheLifecycleListener();
    p2pListener.setProperty(""mcast-port"", ""19991"");
    server.getEmbedded().addLifecycleListener(p2pListener);
    sessionManager = new DeltaSessionManager();
    server.getRootContext().setManager(sessionManager);

Here the EmbeddedTomcat class is simply a wrapper for Embedded - I'm passing in the context, port and 'JVM route' - nothing special. Then I add a listener which should be the programmatic equivalent of having the following server.xml snippet:

<Server>
    <Listener className=""PeerToPeerCacheLifecycleListener""/>
</Server>

DeltaSessionManager performs custom session management and thus extends ManagerBase and implements Lifecycle and SessionManager.

During the start of DeltaSessionManager I initialize the listener by doing

    this.lifecycle.fireLifecycleEvent(START_EVENT, null);

The listener picks up this event and starts.

All works nicely under Tomcat 6, but breaks under Tomcat 7.0.12. My initial investigation shows that the LifecycleEvent, being fired, is not reaching the Embedded component which is where the listener is registered.

Removing the overridden Lifecycle methods from Embedded (so that the Lifecyle processing happens in LifecycleBase) seems to work as the triggered event then reaches my listener."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51344

I've only seen this failure when SSL was running on a Solaris machine.  (uname

When attempted on Windows, we were unable to duplicate the error.  This reliably
fails when attempted on this specific Solaris machine.  If I get a chance, I'll
try to create a test-case and see if I can reproduce this on other Solaris
machines.  Unfortunately, this was a show-stopper for a release that's being
made today so I'm pressed for time.

Basically, what happens is that we're using a JSP page to create an SVG file. 
Because of this, we have to set the Content-Type header to ""image/svg+xml"". 
When the MIME type is set to this value, the page fails to load in Internet
Explorer 6 (SP1) with a message of ""connection failed"" or something similar. 
When an attempt was made in Opera, Opera responded by crashing.  Mozilla
successfully downloaded the file, though.

However, when resetting the MIME type in the page to ""text/plain"" all three
browsers can access the page without failure.  By back-revving Tomcat to version
4.1.29, we were able to resolve this issue and access the page in all three
browsers.

I'll try and create a test-case later today and verify that it isn't just our
SVG JSP that's failing but any that creates SVG but I'm currently pressed for

On the server side, the async request completes normally, and everything looks hunky dory, but the client never gets ANY response from the server.  It appears that Tomcat simply times out after the default 10 seconds and closes the connection.  No headers are returned, no content, nothing.  I've confirmed with thread dumps that the server isn't stuck.

Yet...if you use response.setStatus and response.setHeader instead, it works absolutely fine.  The client gets the response every time.

I put together a very simple test that isolates the issue reliably:

See the README in there for details.

JSP script reproduces the bug. Uncomment lines 46, 47 to see the real problem.

Hello, 

This is observed in Tomcat 6.0.26, Java 1.6 (Netbeans 6.9.1 bundle).

The MapELResolver getType method returns the class of the kept object instead of Object.class. The Java specification says, ""If the base object is a map, [getType] returns the most general acceptable type for a value in this map"", which should mostly be Object.class.

This makes impossible, for example, 1) to set a String value to a map expression, if previously that key was mapped to an Integer; 2) if we are putting an Integer to the value which is currently the String, the Integer gets coerced to the String (according to org.apache.el.parser.AstValue implementation, see lines 153-157.)

The attached JSP script reproduces this bug.

I couldn't figure out whether it is connected with bug 44637 (seems that request was reverse to mine).

(markt)|HttpSessionListener.sessionCreated() is called a second time when user is authenticated with no matching sessionDestroyed() call.|"When my web application has a HttpSessionListener configured in its web.xml, then that classes sessionCreated() is called when a user is assigned a new session.

However, that method is *also* called when that user authenticates itself and the session is assigned a new ID (whether or not this is actually a ""new session"" can be disputed, but that's not the point of this bug).

When the session is removed (due to a timeout, for example), then a single sessionDestroyed() call is executed.

When the HttpSessionListener manages some kind of external resource, this behaviour leads to a resource leak, because sessionCreated() is called twice, while sessionRemoved() is only called once!

I'm aware of the reason for changing the session ID and (somehow) understand why sessionCreated() is called again (after all there's a new session ID), but there must be *some* way for the SessionListener to be notified that the ""old session"" no longer exists.

Tomcat correctly serves MPEG 4 files with a standardized file extension of .mp4, as video/mp4.

Common but non-standard mpeg4 files also use of the extensions .m4a and .m4v, which are unknown to Tomcat and are therefore served without any ""Content-Type"" header. This behaviour leads Internet Explorer to display garbage when following a link to such a file.

This patch adds the correct MIME type for MPEG 4 files with extensions m4a, m4b, m4r and m4v. (It omits the m4p extension, which is both not widely used, and of limited interest since the data is encrypted.)

OS:  Windows 2008 Server (x64)

Compression enabled on both HTTP and HTTPS connectors.

When using standard blocking IO HTTP/1.1 over a period of 2+ days under moderate traffic, Tomcat 7 will begin to occasionally serve the incorrect responses for a request.

Incorrect responses span a variety behaviors
* Serving a javascript (.js) file instead of HTML or Image
* Serving the wrong image
* Serving a .css file instead of HTML, javascript file, or Image

This behavior has been observed in both HTTP & HTTPS.

Another observation is that if the wrong response is served, the response is at least for something that was also requested and not something random.


Once the behavior was detected, I used WebScarab as a proxy to monitor the entire Browser <--> Tomcat conversation.  I was able to confirm a scenario like the following:
--------
ImageA.gif
ImageB.gif

Each has different file size, ETAG, etc.

GET ImageB.gif returned ImageA.gif (with ImageA.gif's ETAG, headers, binary content, and content size)
-------

This report corroborates another report discovered in the wild:
http://www.apacheserver.net/q11460/Tomcat-serving-wrong-content

In the above report, the person requested a page and received an image.

No reproduction steps have been identified to trigger this condition.  The only thing the above reporter & I noticed is that Tomcat needs to be up for a while and serve traffic throughout that period.  Once the condition has been established it is still seemingly random when it occurs.

Whenever it begins to happen, however, disable caching & keep reloading an image-heavy page until you see obvious misplaced images or other things. Using a debugging proxy will allow you to verify that incorrect content is served.

Switching to NIO appears to bypass the problem or at least NIO does not exhibit the same behavior.  As the other reporter had noted, restarting Tomcat will clear the condition.  

My hypothesis is that there is some condition within Tomcat & Blocking IO where a series of (pipelined?) requests (images, css, js) spawned from a page can become confused resulting in swapped responses (A <--> B) or duplicated responses (A & A).  Maybe some output buffer is getting clobbered.  Based upon Http11Processor, pipelined requests are constrained to the same Socket so I do not believe there is a risk of swapping responses across users.  It is unknown if this bug could be deliberately exploited in some way.


Needless to say, a server that is serving incorrect content justifies a very serious severity rating. I would not recommend using BIO in any Production environment for the time being."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50957

SSLProtocol: 'Protocol which may be used for communicating with clients. The default is ""all"", with other acceptable values being ""SSLv2"", ""SSLv3"", ""TLSv1"" and ""SSLv2+SSLv3"".'

Misconfiguration of an SSLProtocol should never silently fall back to enabling all protocols.  At minimum, misconfiguration of this value should result in logged error messages.  Since SSLv2 is vulnerable to several attacks known to have some serious security flaws even allowing the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks, I think a misconfiguration should cause the connector to fail.

OVERVIEW:

In all of the most recent versions of Tomcat 7, including Trunk. When running with APR SSL and the site is accessed using an improper SSL handshake, then a SEVERE NullPointerException will is logged into catalina.out.


STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

It's pretty easy to test this, just type the following:


curl http://localhost:8444/

Where 8444 is the port that SSL is running on for Tomcat 7. 

ACTUAL RESULTS:

If you look in the catalina.out when you do this, you'll see the following stack trace and error message:

EXPECTED RESULTS:

The expected behavior is for Tomcat to not generate a NullPointerException when someone improperly accesses the SSL port.

patch to translate jsp-file elements to jspServlet init params

A <servlet> element in web.xml can include a jsp-file rather than a servlet class.

This requires a bunch of runtime code, some of which is marked ""hold your nose"".

Instead, it's possible to supply the jsp-file as an init-param to the jsp servlet instance that is set up to handle this <servlet> element.  This makes runtime handling of these jsp servlets identical to all other servlets and transfers the small amount of jsp-aware code still needed in catalina to the deployment phase.

The attached patch appears to pass all the tomcat tests and doesn't appear to cause any tck problems in the geronimo-tomcat integration.

In this patch, JspServlet will still respond to the jsp file as a request attribute but catalina won't send it.  Thus jasper is backwards compatible with earlier catalina versions but catalina is not backward compatible for explicitly mentioned jsp-file in servlet elements with earlier jasper versions.

It would be helpful to geronimo to apply the JspServlet patch even if the catalina changes aren't applied as we are using this technique in the geronimo-jetty integration and are subclassing JspServlet to provide this behavior."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49916

(markt)|ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException after setting org.apache.jasper.runtime.BodyContentImpl.LIMIT_BUFFER=true|"First of all, I know that there has been a bug regarding a similar problem before and that it was fixed. But currently this bugs occurs even with tomcat version 6.0.32.

We have a problem with the tomcat runnign with the parameter org.apache.jasper.runtime.BodyContentImpl.LIMIT_BUFFER=true.

After the tomcat has just started, everything is fine but after one or two days a lot of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occur on random pages of the application.

Tomcats started without this parameter don't seem to have that problem.

Unfortunately we weren't able reproduce the bug locally, It appears only on our production system.

Could there be a concurrency problem, that only shows if a lot it going on on the platform?

I can provide two small stackstraces that can show the classes where the problem occurs:

Scenario:

* tomcat starts, as user u1, with only the manager application in place;
* it is configured as to not deploy automatically;
* user u1 copies a webapp tree into $CATALINA_HOME/webapps, which it
can since it has write/execute access to this directory;
* the manager webapp is called to deploy that new web application;
* [in between, credentials on the deployed webapp directory are
changed so that user u1 cannot remove the webapp at all]
* the manager webapp is called to undeploy that application, BUG: it
answers OK, but it is not.

The manager webapp documentation explicitly states that undeploying an
application means that the webapp tree is removed - but of course, in
this case it isn't. Use case below, where $CATALINA_HOME/webapps is a symlink to /var/lib/o3/tomcat/installs:

----

# webapp tree is created by other means. Now deploying the application:
[o3@tomcat-r8 cockpit]$ wget -O - -q --http-user=tomcat --http-password=tomcat http://localhost:8080/manager/text/deploy'?path=/cockpit&war=file:/var/lib/o3/tomcat/installs/cockpit'
OK - Deployed application at context path /cockpit
[...]
# In another terminal:

/var/lib/o3/tomcat/installs
# All files are created with umask 022. Just change the owner:
[root@tomcat-r8 installs]# chown -R root.root cockpit/
[...]
# Back to the first terminal:
[o3@tomcat-r8 cockpit]$ wget -O - -q --http-user=tomcat --http-password=tomcat
http://localhost:8080/manager/text/undeploy?path=/cockpit
OK - Undeployed application at context path /cockpit
# Here is the bug: even though the command returns OK, the tree still exists.
# The webapp is stopped, but it is not undeployed.
[o3@tomcat-r8 cockpit]$ wget -O - -q --http-user=tomcat
--http-password=tomcat  http://localhost:8080/manager/text/list|sed 1d
/manager:running:9:/usr/share/tomcat7/webapps/manager  
/cockpit:stopped:0:cockpit
# Listing the contents of $CATALINA_HOME/webapps, we see that the tree is still 
# there:
[o3@tomcat-r8 cockpit]$ ls /var/lib/o3/tomcat/installs
cockpit

The documentation states:

----
WARNING - This command will delete any web application artifacts that exist within appBase directory (typically ""webapps"") for this virtual host. This will
delete the the application .WAR, if present, the application directory resulting either from a deploy in unpacked form or from .WAR expansion as well as the XML Context definition from $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/ directory.
----

This turns out to be false in this case. While the application is stopped, the web application artifacts are NOT removed. The
undeploy command should have failed with, say ""FAIL - context was stopped but some articats remain, check access rights"". What's more, the logs
don't mention that the webapp tree has failed to be removed at all.

If I chown back the webapp tree to its rightful owner, then the webapp
is indeed undeployed as intended: all artifacts are destroyed.

The culprit code seems to be at org/apache/catalina/manager/ManagerServlet.java, methods undeploy() and undeployDir(). Both use the .delete() method of File objects, but fail to check their return code."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50984

(markt)|Reloading context orphans currently open jndi datasource connections|"I fiddled around with this a while and have determined to the best of my ability
that this is a real bug.  I have a jndi datasource connected to a postgresql
server.  I have two jndi resources (a reader and writer) so that later I can
implement a system with replication etc and deal with writes and reads to
different connections.  To summarize, after using the system, there are two
connections to postgres that get reused -- one reader and writer.  Under load,
this number increases and will slowly go back down.  I usually end up with two
idle connections (one reader and one writer) left under no load.  If you reload
the context where the datasource is at (it's a context specific datasource), the
number of connections will jump by two when used.  Each reload produces 2 more
connections min until I restart the server.  It appears that after a reload, the
'persisted connections' get abandoned / orphaned.  Eventually, I hit my max
connections and cannot aquire any more and the system fails.  I have tried the
abandond collection parameters and have added debug logging to my code to ensure
that I am indeed calling close on the connections I checkout, even on exceptions
and error cases.  Under normal useage without reloads, no connection leakage
happens.

org.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.register(AuthenticatorBase.java:688)

Please, see the following link 
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=39255

This bug has been fixed for Tomcat 5.5.16, but it looks to appear again in Tomcat 7.

This is the excerpt from AuthenticatorBase.java:
   public void register(Request request, HttpServletResponse response,
                            Principal principal, String authType,
                            String username, String password) {

                + authType + ""'"");

It is seen that there is no more condition to verify if principal is null.

Specifically, the NullPointerException is thrown when calling HttpServletRequest.logout method from a JSF managed bean. According to Java EE 6 documentation, the logout method establishes null as the value returned when getUserPrincipal, getRemoteUser, and getAuthType is called on the request. Hence, the exception thrown."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50855

anonymous accessible. I believe that for security purposes this should not be 
necessary if we are validating the user by binding to the directory. In that 
case the roles could be accessible to any bound user or that particular user. I 
discussed this very briefly on the Tomcat user list. It sounds like this had 
been discussed previously and for whatever reason, the idea rejected. Anyhow I 
submit that there is a bug, either in the code - which requires the roles to be 
anonymous, or in the documentation which does not make it clear that this is 
the case (at least in ""Tomcat 4 Servlet/JSP Container - Realm Configuration HOW-
TO). It seems reasonable to me that if we are binding to the directory to 
authenticate, we would have that user's access to roles. Perhaps the 
documentation should more explicetly state that this is not the case.

In the hope that it would be accepted as an enhancement, I am going to attempt 
to attach a modified JNDIRealm that uses the authenticated connection to obtain 
the roles.

simple change would allow the role base to be specified relative to the user

roleBase - the base entry for the role search. If not specified, the search 
base is the top level directory context. If specified it may optionally include 
pattern replacements ""{0}""..""{n}"" corrosponding to the name parts of the user's 
distinguished name (as returned by javax.naming.Name.get()).

For example, in the <Realm> defintion in server.xml you could specify the 
roleBase as:

Because the index ix is already incremented in line 325, after reading the current byte b (e.g. the %-character), this test fails if ""%A4"" is at the end, but does not fail for ""%A4n"".

Simple fix: In line 329 the '>=' should be replaced by a '>':

https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50747#c3

In o.a.c.connector.Response there is a feature that Response#setContentLength(int) ignores the call if usingWriter flag is true.


My comments are:

1) It concerns only multi-byte charsets such as UTF-8. There is nothing wrong with calling setContentLength() if it is a single-byte charset.

2) There is no such protection in Response#setHeader(), #setIntHeader(), #addHeader(), #addIntHeader() methods. Calling them will bypass the protection.

Patch for this issue vs. 6_0_29.

I would like to configure JNDIRealm to authenticate to an Active Directory server using userPattern=DOMAIN\{0}. Active Directory will accept this username in bind requests, however context.getAttributes(...) will fail if that name is used. JNDIRealm makes a request for user attributes before logging in, even when there are no user attributes to request. As a result, the above configuration fails with an InvalidNameException:

javax.naming.InvalidNameException: DOMAIN\username: [LDAP: error code 34 -
0000208F: LdapErr: DSID-0C090654, comment: Error processing name, data 0,
vece ]; remaining name 'DOMAIN\username

I have a patch for this (against 6.0.29) that I will attach. The patch fixes the issue for my specific case (bind mode, no roles), but it seems like there is a more fundamental problem in accessing the user's attributes before the user is even authenticated. This makes sense if it is configured for password comparison mode, but for bind mode it seems unnecessary until the user's password is validated. If only there were a way to get the DN of the authenticated user (not just the name that was used to authenticate), then it would be straightforward to fix this to query for roles after auth. I could not find such an API. I would be happy to write that patch if someone can point me in the right direction on that API.

Hi!

I'm writing you from ZeroTurnaround and we are currently building JRebel integration with new containers aiming to implement the servlet3 standard. I've stumbled on a bug in your implementation that is actually at the very core of the servlet standard and thus quite important, and actually a major issue for our integration.

Namely, i'm copy-pasting you a fragment of the reference javadoc of the servlet3 spec for the method ServletContext#getResourcePaths():

============= SPEC START =================

For example, for a web application containing:

   /welcome.html
   /catalog/index.html
   /catalog/products.html
   /catalog/offers/books.html
   /catalog/offers/music.html
   /customer/login.jsp
   /WEB-INF/web.xml
   /WEB-INF/classes/com.acme.OrderServlet.class
   /WEB-INF/lib/catalog.jar!/META-INF/resources/catalog/moreOffers/books.html
 

getResourcePaths(""/"") would return {""/welcome.html"", ""/catalog/"", ""/customer/"", ""/WEB-INF/""}, and getResourcePaths(""/catalog/"") would return {""/catalog/index.html"", ""/catalog/products.html"", ""/catalog/offers/"", ""/catalog/moreOffers/""}. 

============= SPEC END =================


Now run my test-application, you'll discover immediately that Tomcat doesn't respect that standard. getResourcesPath(""/catalog"") would not return ""/catalog/moreOffers"" if there were 2 embedded jars containing web-fragments. And even more importantly, had there been a new folder coming solely from a jar's META-INF/resources, this wouldn't get listed with getResourcePaths(""/"").

Please note that these are important issues! Many frameworks rely on various scanning techniques for recursive resource lookup, and so forth.

I've tested this thing with Tomcat 7.0.6 and 7.0.8, problems are present with both.

(Btw, we've received information about the same problems from users of latest glassfish version as well.. i think they are just re-using this part of tomcat and thus getting the same problems... not sure.)

Thanks a lot if you can have a look at this!"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50802

Other|Tomcat 7.0.9 (markt)|fix|50743|Cache CheckStyle results between builds to speed up validation. Patch provided by Oliver. (markt)|Cache results to speed up Checkstyle #build|"Created attachment 26627 [details]
Patch to enable caching

Checkstyle supports caching files that have successfully passed with no errors, so that these files are not processed again on subsequent invocations of Checkstyle until the files are modified again. As the output below shows, this speeds up the Checkstyle from 51 seconds to 15 seconds.

The attached patch, based on trunk, adds support for caching Checkstyle results. The cache files are stored in the ${tomcat.output} directory, so are removed whenever an ""ant clean"" is performed.

You could get more sophisticated and store the cache files outside of the ${tomcat.output} directory to save history across ""ant clean"" invocations. In this case, you then need to make the build logic smarter to invalidate the cache files if any of the Checkstyle configuration files change. Let me know if you are interested in a patch to do this.

Why?  Here are a couple of use cases that this attribute can fix:

- CATALINA_BASE configuration is kept under version control.  For example, I keep all of my configuration in subversion.  This includes appBase which has svn:externals to pull in the application code.  So, appBase/.svn gets deployed.

- A context defined in server.xml but living in appBase will currently get double-deployed.  The recommendation is to move the app outside of appBase, but this attribute would allow it to live there with the instance's other apps."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50205

This works fine in Glassfish v3. However, in Tomcat the getParts() returns null and it works only inside a servlet with @MultipartConfig annotation.

This is too strict. This makes it hard if not impossible to process multipart/form-data requests transparently with help of a Filter (i.e. creating a new parametermap and replacing the original one in HttpServletRequest).

It is true that the Servlet 3.0 spec tells nothing about the use of this method inside a Filter, but this is in my opinion an oversight. There is no other way to obtain the parts than parsing the stream yourself with good 'ol Apache Commons FileUpload.

Note OutputBuffer.flush() call above.


If I remove AccessLogValve from configuration, the response.getContentLengthLong();
call returns ""8"" as expected and call stack is:

===============================================

You should use full qualified names instead of a bunch of import-staments.

would become
  _jspxFactory = javax.servlet.jsp.JspFactory.getDefaultFactory();
and if you don't already do,
you should use the this-reference where possible.

Patch file to replace new with valueOf, and some valueOf with parse

While perusing the code, I noticed that java\org\apache\jasper\runtime\JspRuntimeLibrary.java code was doing a few things that I think can be improved:

1.  coerce methods were instantiating new objects, only to convert them to primitives.  For example:

    return Boolean.valueOf(s).booleanValue();

This can be rewritten (and simplified) as:

    return Boolean.parseBoolean(s);

This pattern was repeated for numerous primitive types.


2.  Objects were being instantiated using new instead of calling valueOf.  For example:

    return new Byte((byte) 0);

instead of:

    return Byte.valueOf((byte) 0);

According to the Java API, valueOf should generally be used in preference to the constructor as this method is likely to yield significantly better space and time performance.

3.  toString methods are instantiating a temporary object just to turn it into a string value.  For example:

    return new Integer(i).toString();

This can be rewritten (and simplified) as:

    return Integer.toString(i);

This pattern was repeated for numerous primitive types.


I took the liberty of creating a patch.  These changes should yield improved performance and reduce the memory footprint."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46819

svn diff

This enhancement proposal addresses three separate issues with the RpcChannel tribes component.

1. There is a minor bug in a catch(InterruptedException) clause, in which a call to Thread#interrupted() is made, as opposed to Thread#interrupt(), as it should be.

2. The RpcChannel API user registers an RpcCallback to be notified of communication events. However, there is no callback method for the case where the sending of a response message fails. This proposal includes the addition of a corresponding callback for such cases. To ensure backwards-compatibility, the additional callback method has been declared in a sub-interface of RpcCallback, named RpcCallback2 for the time being.

3. Since the tribes classes are loaded by the tomcat loader, if the messages sent through tribes are instances of classes defined in the webapp, attemps to deserialize them will fail. AbstractReplicatedMap includes a mechanism for the API user to specify class loaders to be used when deserializing map entries. This enhancement proposal includes a similar mechanism for the RpcChannel.

Overview:

Parallel deployment works like a charm in a non-clustered environment. But when deploying a versioned app (APPNAME##VERSION.war) to a farm deployer directory, it seems that the filename encoding of the ## delimiter is not translated correctly to identify the war file on the file system:

## is translated to %23%23

1. Create a version app file
2. Deploy file to watched farm deployer directory

Expected result:
- Versioned app is copyied to cluster members and deployed

Actual result:
- Versioned app is NOT copyied to cluster members.

(markt)|It is not possible to have multiple instacnes of same docBase inside appBase|"When I set docBase in context tag to relative path it is not possible to have more then one Context with same docBase. For example

We have two XML files for our application in folder Catalina/localhost.
iis.xml and iisstampa.xml. Both of them have the same docBase=""iis"".
appBase is set to webbaps in Host tag in server.xml.

iis.xml is loaded corectly, but iisstampa.xml is not. This is because inside of method org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.deployDescriptor there is part that recognizes that {tomcat_home}/webapps/iis folder is inside of appBase an docBase attribute is ignored by calling context.setDocBase(null). This causes Tomcat looks for folder iisstampa inside of appbase which of course does not exist.

If we put this context and docBase outside appBase everything works corectly.

But described situation is in conflict with documentation because it is not possible to have multiple instances of same docBase if the docBase is inside appBase.

This behavour is introduced in revision SVN 303926 of Tomcat 5.5 by remm (Remy Maucherat) as a solution of bug 34840 to recognize if the context path is external.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.6 (markt)|add|10526|Add an option to the Authenticators to force the creation of a session on authentication which may offer some performance benefits. (markt)|Authenticators do not always cache the Principal|"Once a user is authenticated a Principal object is supposed to be cached for 
the duration of the user's session. This is especially important when using 
JDBCRealm or JNDIRealm to reduce the load on external authentication services.

Most authenticators (BasicAuthenticator, SSLAuthenticator and 
DigestAuthenticator) call AuthenticatorBase.register()to cache the Principal. 
However register() does nothing if a session object does not already exist, so 
caching does not occur when the application does not create a session object 
itself. The problem can be seen by setting a security constraint on tomcat-docs 
and then browsing the Tomcat documentation - the external authentication 
service is hit on every request.

The problem does not occur with form based login, because FormAuthenticator 
caches the Principal itself and creates a new session if necessary to do it.

Probably the best fix would be to change AuthenticatorBase.register() to create 
a new session by calling getSession(request, true) instead of getSession
(request, false). However, perhaps there is a reason why this is not being 
done - though if so I cannot see what it is.

An alternative is to change the concrete authentication classes to make sure a 
session exists before calling register(), e.g.

Based on a patch by Sylvain Laurent. (markt)|Memory leaks protection does not detect leaks triggered by JSP pages code|"Created attachment 25077 [details]
webapps/examples/foo.jsp

The memory leaks protection feature of TC6/TC7 is able to heal certain types of memory leaks caused by servlet code (where classes are loaded by WebappClassLoader), but does not provide a cure for ones caused by JSP code (where classes are loaded by JasperLoader).

I think that is of little concern, as the code that triggers a memory leak is unlikely to be present on a JSP page or a tag file, but at least it provides us with an example to test the ""Find leaks"" diagnostics in the Manager webapp.


To reproduce:
1. Place the attached foo.jsp into the examples webapp
2. Open http://localhost:8080/examples/foo.jsp
3. Open the Manager web application
4. Reload or stop/start the examples application
5. Press the ""Find leaks"" button in the Manager
6. The message will be displayed that ""/examples"" app triggered a memory leak.

The leak is caused by foo.jsp creating a ThreadLocal holding an instance of some inner class of that JSP. (That inner class was loaded through JasperLoader, and thus was not detected when enumerating ThreadLocals in leaks protection code.)

7. Another ThreadLocal (holding a reference to some servlet) is successfully cleared by memory leak protection code when the examples application is stopped. You can see a message about that in the Tomcat logs."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48837

The method StandardEngine.logAccess(..) performs lookup of a default AccessLog implementation and caches it as StandardEngine.defaultAccessLog.  This value is not updated if the default host or its ROOT webapp are changed.  The most important use case here is when the ROOT webapp is redeployed or restarted.

To reproduce:
1. Configure an access log valve in the ROOT webapp. Remove access log valves from Engine and Host if there are any.
2. Start Tomcat and do some malformed request
3. Undeploy and redeploy the ROOT webapp.
E.g. rename ROOT -> ROOT1, wait until undeployment happens and rename it back.
4. Do some malformed request.
Expected behaviour: the request has to be logged.
Actual behaviour: the request is not logged.


Notes:
1. This does not happen if an access log valve is also configured on the Host or Engine. The default server.xml of Tomcat 7 does have such a valve in the default Host.
2. Restarting the ROOT webapp (e.g. touching its web.xml) is not enough to trigger this. (Apparently it does not cause closing of the valve).
3. It is not detected as a memory leak. (Apparently the Valve is not loaded with webapp's classloader).

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.6 (markt)|fix|50413|Ensure 304 responses are not returned when using static files as error pages. (markt/kkolinko)|Tomcat returns 304 instead of 404 response for static custom 404 error file|"When using a static html file for 404 errors and the client sends a request to a file whoch doesn't exist, and adds a ""If-Modified-Since"" header with a date that is newer than the modification date of the static error file, then Tomcat returns ""302 Not Modofied"" instead of ""404 Not Found"".

Steps to reproduce:
1) Make a simple webapp that uses a static html file as custom error page for 404 errors, like this (web.xml):

  <error-page>
    <error-code>404</error-code>
    <location>/errorpages/404.html</location>
  </error-page>

2) Do a GET request to a URL which points to a file that doesn't exist, and add a ""If-Modified-Since"" header with a date that is newer than the modification date of the 404 error file (the date may also be in the future), e.g.

GET /MyWebApp/AUrlToAFileWhichDoesNotExist.gif HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Keep-Alive: 115
Connection: keep-alive
If-Modified-Since: Tue, 08 Nov 2015 15:07:52 GMT 

(replace ""MyWebApp"" with your webapp's name)

3) Tomcat returns ""HTTP/1.1 302 Not Modified"" instead of ""HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"".


Actual Results: Tomcat returns a ""302 Not Modified"" response, because it seems to compare the date of the ""If-Modified-Header"" with the date of the static 404 error file.

Expected Results: Tomcat returns a ""404 Not Found"" response, because the requested file does not exist.


If you omit the ""If-Modified-Since"" header or use a date that is older than the date of the error file, Tomcat correctly returns ""404 Not Found"", but adds an ""Last-Modified"" header with the modification date of the 404 file.


This behavior caused invalid 302 responses to be sent over the ISAPI redirector (bug 50363, with enabled chunked encoding support) when I was viewing my site in Firefox and pressed F5 to refresh it, because I think as of bug 49591, Tomcat uses chunked encoding for this response, which the ISAPI redirector didn't check.

AFAICS in MemcachedBackupSessionManager I could override remove(Session session, boolean update) with calling super.remove(session, false) for invalid sessions.

Another option would be to change StandardSession.expire(StandardSession.java:840) so that it does not invoke manager.remove(this, true) but manager.remove(this, false).

Or even better: change ManagerBase.remove(ManagerBase.java:802) to invoke some session.getCreationTimeInternal() which skips validation.

What do you think?

(markt)|Multiple X-Forwarded-For headers not handled by RemoteIP valve|"When a request comes in with multiple X-Forwarded-For headers the RemoteIP valve should be examining all of them in reverse order.

As defined by the standard:
""Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)]. It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one ""field-name: field-value"" pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each separated by a comma. The order in which header fields with the same field-name are received is therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy MUST NOT change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded.""

thus:
(a)
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.3
X-Forwarded-For: 222.234.0.4

Is semantically equivalent to:
(b)
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.3, 222.234.0.4

However (a) is not handled by the RemoteIP valve as it only ever looks at the first header.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.6 (markt)|add|50541|Add support for setting the size limit and time limit for LDAP searches when using the JNDI Realm with userSearch. (markt)|JNDIRealm: support configuring LDAP sizeLimit (countLimit in SearchControls)|"Today, when enabling an application's LDAP authentication through Active Directory, I've discovered that with apparently a completely correct LDAP Realm configuration on the Tomcat side, AD returns the following error all the time:

LDAP: error code 1 - 000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C0906DD, comment: In order to perform this operation a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, v1771

After some hours of Googling and experimenting with referrals, subtree search modes et cetera, I've found out (through network packet analysis) that the problem is caused by LDAP sizeLimit being set to zero in the searches sent by Tomcat.

After closer inspection of Tomcat source code, I've dug out this class:

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/catalina/realm/JNDIRealm.java

And this code fragment in the method getUserBySearch(DirContext context, String username, String[] attrIds):



        // Set up the search controls
        SearchControls constraints = new SearchControls();

        if (userSubtree) {
            constraints.setSearchScope(SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE);
        }
        else {
            constraints.setSearchScope(SearchControls.ONELEVEL_SCOPE);
        }

        // Specify the attributes to be retrieved
        if (attrIds == null)
            attrIds = new String[0];
        constraints.setReturningAttributes(attrIds);

        NamingEnumeration<SearchResult> results =
            context.search(userBase, filter, constraints);

As you can see (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/realm-howto.html#JNDIRealm), currently there's no way to customize other search controls than search scope and returning attributes by means of XML configuration.

In javax.naming.directory.SearchControls, the LDAP sizeLimit is determined by the countLimit property:
http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/naming/directory/SearchControls.html#setCountLimit(long)

I propose to create a new configuration attribute for the Realm XML element that would enable setting this limit, and naming it ""sizeLimit"" (not ""countLimit"" like the Java property, because in LDAP world people are used to the former term). While we're at it, adding ""timeLimit"" (measured in milliseconds) attribute would be also nice.

So for example one would be able to set 1000 entries sizeLimit and 5 seconds timeLimit this way:

<Realm className=""org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm"" debug=""99""
     connectionURL=""ldap://localhost:389""
       userPattern=""uid={0},ou=people,dc=mycompany,dc=com""

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.6 (markt)|fix|50496|Bytes sent in the access log are now counted after compression, chunking etc rather than before. (markt)|AccessLogValve not logging size correctly for %B with enabled compression|"During a log analysis of before and after enabling http/1.1 compression in tomcat 6.0.29 (and also earlier) we see that the access-logs do NOT sow a difference in sizes reported.

Drilling down into the issue it seems as if the size reported with %B is not taking compression into account even though the documentation says:
%B - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers

A quick comparison with the apache httpd 2.2 shows that httpd IS logging compressed data sizes.

Here an easy means to replicate:

* take a stock tomcat 6.0.29
* configure tomcat to use compression and enable access logging
* start tomcat
* do 2 web-requests with (say curl) to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ one time without the header ""Acccept-encoding: gzip"" the other time with the header added
* look at the access-logfile and you see that both get reported as 7777 Bytes sent

This is a bit of a pain, as there is no way to report the compressed size in any other way with tomcat (like with logging notes with apache httpd) and it would be very helpful if the real size was available for reporting on efficiency without having to resort to use tcpdump estimates...

(markt)|PropFind 404 error after MkCol succes|"A propfind call on a resource returns a 404 error when executed after a mkcol for the same resource.

When the first request would be omitted, the third request would have been succesful, as the following access log shows;
  127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jan/2011:14:10:39 +0100] ""MKCOL /webdav/output/81a97360-ea49-44d3-b764-d8c7e60e885e/ HTTP/1.1"" 201 -

Note: After a few seconds, the response to propfind for that resource is OK again. This suggests this has to do with caching.

Note2: This situation sounds similar to call 21288 (FIXED - 'DirContext caching problem with Dreamweaver 6 when recursively creating directories').

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.6 (markt)|fix|47319|"Return the client's IP address rather than null for calls to getRemoteHost() when the APR connector is used with enableLookups=""true"" but the IP address is not resolveable. (markt)"|With APR, getRemoteHost() returns NULL for unknown clients|"Hello,

I posted this info to the tomcat users mailing list and am following Mark Thomas' advice to open a bug report:

My setup is a RedHat 5 server (32 bit) running Tomcat 6.0.20 with Tomcat Native 1.1.16 libraries and Sun JDK 1.6.0_14.  I've built and installed Tomcat Native as described in http://tomcat.apache.org/native-doc/

The server.xml file has been modified to add enableLookups=""true"" to the HTTP Connector entry:

    <Connector port=""8080"" protocol=""HTTP/1.1""
               connectionTimeout=""20000""
               enableLookups=""true""
               redirectPort=""8443"" />

Now, when the client exists in the DNS, reverse lookups via HttpServletRequest.getRemoteHost() work fine whether or not I'm using APR.

The problem is, when attempting a reverse lookup for a client that is not found in the naming service, the behaviour of getRemoteHost() depends on whether or not APR is being used.  Specifically, without APR, the method returns the dotted-string form of the IP address (consistent with the doc http://java.sun.com/webservices/docs/1.6/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getRemoteHost() ).  However, when APR is enabled, the method returns NULL.

I can reproduce the problem using a simple test servlet:

# cat GetAddress.java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class GetAddress extends HttpServlet {
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response)
    throws IOException, ServletException{
    response.setContentType(""text/html"");
    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();   
    out.println(""<b><font color='red'>Hostname of request : </font></b>""
        +request.getRemoteHost()+""<p>"");
    out.println(""<b><font color='blue'>IP Address of request : </font></b>""
        +request.getRemoteAddr());
  }
}

If LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to $CATALINA_HOME/lib, catalina.out confirms APR is enabled:

05-Jun-2009 11:09:01 org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
INFO: Loaded APR based Apache Tomcat Native library 1.1.16.
05-Jun-2009 11:09:01 org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
INFO: APR capabilities: IPv6 [true], sendfile [true], accept filters [false], random [true].
05-Jun-2009 11:09:02 org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol init

From my client unknown to the DNS, the web page shows ""Hostname of request: null ... IP Address of request: <client IP address>""

Now, after simply unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH and restarting Tomcat (catalina.out confirms APR is not used), a request from the same client correctly shows ""Hostname of request: <client IP address>... IP Address of request: <client IP address>""


This behaviour with APR is causing problems for a third-party application that relies on identifying the client IP/host for authentication - as the code does not expect NULL from getRemoteHost() it denies access to the client (coming from another company via LAN-to-LAN VPN).

Any ideas on how to debug this further?  Nothing is logged to catalina.out when the error occurs.  I also had a quick look in the APR source but couldn't find any reference to getRemoteHost or enableLookups so I'm not sure where this side effect is coming from.

Thanks in advance for any feedback,

Best regards

It is reported that ""/examples"" causes a leak.
EXPECTED RESULT:
No leaks.

This issue is apparently caused by an instance of org.apache.jasper.compiler.JspDocumentParser$EnableDTDValidationException

http://marc.info/?l=tomcat-dev&m=129211856426188&w=2

Additional comments:
1) This issue affects the first request that loads the JspDocumentParser class. Subsequent requests do not cause the issue. Thus only a single webapp is affected.
2) The issue does not happen when there is no webapp code in the call stack. I.e., it does not happen if the JSPX page was requested directly.
That is why the reproduction recipe uses <jsp:include/>.

Possible solutions:
1) Preload the JspDocumentParser class when Tomcat starts.
2) Do not cache the Exception. Create a new instance each time.
3) Override the fillInStackTrace() method, like it was done in AbstractDOMParser$Abort in Apache Xerces [2]. I do not know, whether that helps or not.

Web applications|Tomcat 7.0.6 (markt)|fix|21157|Ensure cookies are written before the response is committed in the Cookie example. Patch provided by Stefan Radzom. (markt)|CookieExample is setting cookie after writing data|"A servlet can not set the headers and cookies after writing data to the 
servlet's output stream. Once the servlet writes data, headers are committed. 
However CookieExample writes some data first before doing addCookie on the 
response. 

The reason why this code works at all even with the above bug is: The 
CookieExample is only writing a small amount of data before doing 
response.addCookie. That data is still held in buffer and not yet sent over 
the wire. Hence the headers are not yet committed. So it is pure luck that 
this example works. 

You can easily expose the bug by writing say 20K characters in this example 
before response.addCookie is called. You will see that the cookies that are 
adding to response are not actually sent back to client. 

Fix is simple. Move up the response.addCookie() before response.getWriter()"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21157

Fix to abstract catalina task class to set up redirector correctly

Using the Ant List Task with outputproperty set causes a null pointer exception in the event of any error. For example, if tomcat is not running or the url given is incorrect. Since the bug is in a base class, this probably affects all the ant tasks.

The bug is due to the fact that the code to clean up the redirector is called in the finally block, but the equivalent code to set it up is not. This problem is also present in Tomcat 6.

The attached patch fixes the problem. With the patch in place, using the list task when tomcat is down gives ""Connection refused"" instead."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50552

I fill it up, and submit and I get authenticated and the page
http://myhost/myapp/index.html
is properly shown.


However, if instead of trying to go to a protected resource, I try to go 
directly to the login.jsp page, and that is pretty common since some people 
like to bookmark the login page, then this is what happens:

I go to the login page:
http://myhost/myapp/login.jsp

the login page gets displayed properly. but if I fill it up and submit, the 
browser gets redirected to this address:

http://myhost/myapp/null
and the following error is shown on the browser:
HTTP Status 404 - /null
The requested resource (/null) is not available. 

The behavior that I would like to see is that the default page for the web 
application be shown.

I think this is what is happening:
if I go to a protected resource the url gets saved somewhere in the session
then after I submit the login information, the server redirects the browers to 
the saved location.

But if I go directly to the login page, then there is no url that failed the 
security constraints, and nothing is saved. After I submit, it tries to go to 
whatever is saved (null in this case) and since there is no page named null an 
error is shown. What is needed is an extra check somewhere that says: if the 
saved location is null, then go to the default webapp page."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3839

patch for MBeanFactory.java

When I call MBeanFactory#removeHost operation via JMX(jconsle), I get the following message.

INFO: The destroy() method was called on component [Pipeline[StandardHost[localhost]]] after destroy() had already been called. The second call will be ignored.

StandardPipeline is destroyed two times.
At first, pipeline is destroyed at ContainerBase.java L.1096:
<<ContainerBase.java destroyInternal() L.1094-1097>>
   1094         // Stop the Valves in our pipeline (including the basic), if any
   1095         if (pipeline instanceof Lifecycle) {
   1096             ((Lifecycle) pipeline).destroy();
   1097         }

<<ContainerBase.java destroyInternal() L.1104-1107>>
   1104         // Required if the child is destroyed directly.
   1105         if (parent != null) {
   1106             parent.removeChild(this);
   1107         }
When above-mentioned ""parent"" is StandardEngine, the parent.removeChild() calls the  LifecycleBase#child.destroy(), and child.destroy() calls ContainerBase#destroyInternal().
At this time ContainerBase is StandardHost.
<<ContainerBase.java removeChild() L.960-964>>
    960         // Set child's parent to null to prevent a loop
    961         child.setParent(null);
    962         try {
    963             child.destroy();
    964         } catch (LifecycleException e) {

As a result, pipeline is destroyed again(, and get the above-mentioned info message).

In Tomcat 6.0, child.destroy() is not called from ContainerBase#removeChild().
But, as seen above, the removeChild() that is contained in Tomcat7.0 calls the child.destroy().
IMHO, it might not be better to call the child.destroy() from removeHost().

I made the patch that removed host.destroy() from removeHost().

patch for MapperListener.java

The same five MapperListener is registered as ContainerListener of StandardContext. 

At first when I add StandardHost by using ""Engine addChild operation"" via JMX, same MapperListener is registered as ContainerListener of StandardHost.

StandardEngine.addChild()
->StandardEngine.addChildInternal()
  ->StandardEngine.fireContainerEvent()

      ...
    ->MapperListener.containerEvent() line: 135

Therefore, StandardHost has the same two MapperListener as ContainerListener. 
---

Then, starting StandardHost by using ""Host start operation"", the same five MapperListener is registered as ContainerListener of StandardContext. 

(1)LifecycleState of StandardHost is changed to STARTING.

		AsyncContext context = request.startAsync();

			}

			public void onError(AsyncEvent asyncEvent) throws IOException {}

			public void onStartAsync(AsyncEvent asyncEvent) throws IOException {}
		});
}


It looks like the Servlet 3.0 specification allows to do such call, here's the quotation that explicitly states the flow of the timeouted async contexts (page 18):

""In the event that an asynchronous operation times out, the container must run
through the following steps:
■ Invoke the AsyncListener.onTimeout method on all the AsyncListener
instances registered with the ServletRequest on which the asynchronous
operation was initiated.
■ If none of the listeners called AsyncContext.complete() or any of the
AsyncContext.dispatch methods, perform an error dispatch with a status
code equal to HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.
■ If no matching error page was found, or the error page did not call
AsyncContext.complete() or any of the AsyncContext.dispatch
methods, the container MUST call AsyncContext.complete()""

Second step assumes that the call to dispatch in onTimeout() is allowed."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50308

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.5 (markt)|fix|49860|Complete support for handling trailing headers in chunked HTTP requests. (markt)|getParameters() fails on chunked POST requests with trailers|"Created attachment 25967 [details]
Sample code to expose the issue

Overview: A servlet hosted on Tomcat fails to retrieve the request parameters when the request is using chunked transfer encoding and trailers.

Details: Sending a POST http request from a HTTP/1.1 client that uses chunked as transfer encoding and also includes trailers in the request (per RFC2616 sections 3.6.1 and 14.40):
Request: 
===========================
POST /echo/getBody HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: org.test.chunked.EchoClient (chunked-test)
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
connection: Close
host: localhost:8080
transfer-encoding: chunked

3
a=0
4
&b=1
0
x-Signature: Tuu2
============================

The server responds with an error message (see below) and a stack trace pointing to ChunkedInputFilter class (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc6.0.x/trunk/java/org/apache/coyote/http11/filters/ChunkedInputFilter.java).
The method parseEndChunk() inside this class has a to do comment to handle trailers - this leads me to believe the trailers in chunked requests are not yet supported.

The sample code attached contains means to reproduce the issue:
 - an Eclipse project TestHttpServer that hosts an EchoServlet
 - an Eclipse project TestHttpClient that sends and receives chunked requests and verifies them in a unit test
 - Eclipse's Tomcat server configuration
The code is an extension of the attachments from bug 37794 (https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37794) related to handling chunked requests in general.

Note that when removing the trailer in the request above, the server responds correctly and is able to extract the parameters sent in the request' body.

Here is the error response that the server sends back:

The /test/webapp-3.0/bug45nnn/bug45015b.jsp page of trunk contains the following text:

org.apache.jasper.JasperException: /bug45nnn/bug45015b.jsp(21,30) equal symbol expected


It means, that the parser interprets ""wo"" as an attribute name, ignoring the fact that there is no whitespace before it.


If I write
<tags:echo echo=""hello ""wo=""rld"" />
the test complains that attribute ""wo"" is invalid for the tag,

and finally if I write
<tags:echo echo=""hello ""echo=""rld"" />
the test succeeds, while I would expect it to fail.

I am attaching a patch that adds a testcase based on the last example, though a better testcase is needed that does not use the same attribute name twice.

I think it is a minor issue, because this issue does not affect valid JSP pages, though allows to run some invalid ones.

Hi,

I'm using apache tribes outside of Tomcat.
Although my version is not the latest one, the bug also occurs in Trunk.

It seems that there was a refactor (using executors instead of threads and monitors) and BioReceiver is not scheduling the task.

proposed patch

Hi,

I'm using apache tribes outside of Tomcat.
Although my version is not the latest one, this also applies to trunk.

I have a customer that was using Bio senders (a version before to the excecutors refactor see bug 50183), and there were experiencing some weird behavior. (I couldn't reproduce it, but I guess it is related with the platform since they are using solaris)

My application uses tribes to create an RPC channel. They also had some network issues.
So, in certain occasions, the application invoked a remote method, the remote node processed the invocation and send the answer back (but it is not received in the first node).
So, the timeout occurs and eventually a new RPC invocation occurs. But this time, the second node realized that there is a socket issue when trying to send the answer back (it gets a broken pipe exception). Them the connection is re-established and the message is received without any issues.

My customer is complaining about the timeout that occurred the first time.

To send the message we do the following:
BioSender.pushMessage(.....) {
    ...
    soOut.write(data);
    soOut.flush();
    ...
}
But the flush operation does not warranty that the message was successfully sent to the network. It just warranty that the information was passed to the S.O. 
http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html#flush()

So, in order to avoid this issue I thought that we can modify the RpcChannel to send the reply message using SEND_OPTIONS_USE_ACK option.
Setting this, the remote node will be able to detect situations like the one I commented, and recreate the connection.

I'm attaching a patch with my proposal.


Thanks for your time.

The manager app shows message using the server's default locale whereas it should react on the request Locale.

The attached patch fixes the problem for the ManagerServlet but not for the HTMLManagerServlet.

The patch for WebdavServlet

The WebdavServlet does not work with native Windows clients besides the deprecated Web Folders. The more modern, common and supported by Microsoft client, Windows Mini-Redirector that allows mapping of WebDAV shares to local drives cannot mount a WebDAV share served by tomcat's WebdavServlet.

You can observe this by using the following command from a windows machine:

> net use * http://hostname:8080/webdav

It should fail without the attached patch. The reason is that:

DAV: namespaced elements in a PROPFIND responses can not use a default namespace; each element must be explicitly prefixed with a namespace prefix defined in itself or a parent. If a default namespace is used the client will give no errors, but will not display any resources.

This is mentioned here, albeit for a single Windows version, Windows Server 2003:

Create a web application that uses Axis 1 as SOAP server. Deploy the web application in Tomcat. Make a SOAP call to the webapplication. Undeploy the web application. Wait an hour.
Make a memory dump using jmap, and inspect the memory using jhat.

Actual results
The WebappClassLoader for the web application is still present. Its ""reference chains from rootset"" shows a reference like this:
System Class Reference :

propose fix for a couple possible async listener problems

I asked about these on the dev list and am proposing some simple fixes in case there's agreement that they are bugs.

1. AsyncListeners are subject to resource injection from annotations, so they should be created using the instance manager. To get the instance manager to the AyncContextImpl I added a getInstanceManager() method to the Context interface.  Maybe there's a better way, this interface is currently not very small or simple.

2. various application code can use one of the ServletContext.addListener methods to tell the container to scan for annotations.  Just because tomcat doesn't yet actually scan doesn't mean it should throw an exception if you try this.

- provides notifications to StandardContext of users calling createServlet and addServlet on ApplicationContext/ServletContext so subclasses of StandardContext can implement the spec behavior without subclassing ApplicationContext.

This patch is generated from a tomcat copy that already has several other patches I've proposed applied.  Let me know if there are problems applying it."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50015
Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.4 (markt)|fix|50016|Re-factor isUserInRole() and login()/logout() methods to support JACC implementations and to improve encapsulation. Patch provided by David Jencks. (markt)|bad division of responsibility around isUserInRole and new Request login and logout methods|"Created attachment 26089 [details]
improve division of responsibility for isUserInRole and login/logout methods

There are 2 similar problems that have a bad division of responsibility.

1. Request.isUserInRole tries to prevent jacc implementations and is also wrong.

In the current tomcat implementation, role-ref mappings are first applied to the supplied role and then the target role is tested. If the user is not in the mapped role the original role is tested. However,
(a). jacc requires that this be implemented by constructing a role-ref permission with the current servlet name and the supplied (not mapped) role. So to be reasonably amenable to a jacc implementation Request.isUserInRole should supply the original role and if possible the servlet name to the wrapper.
(b) if there is a mapping, only the mapped role should be checked. Aside from the spec language, consider a web app with two roles A and B and a servlet S that maps A to B and B to A. A user that logs in and is in role A and not B should be able to test in S

is in A >> false
is in B >> true

The current implementation reports true for both A and B.

2. The implementation of the new login and logout methods are excessively intrusive into the internals of the authentication. Both should be delegated directly to the Authenticator. In particular, checking which known Authenticator is installed to see if it supports user/pw login is overly restrictive since other authenticators might be installed. The authenticator also ought to be able to decide if it wants to cache the authentication results."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50016

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.4 (markt)|fix|50059|JARs should always be searched for static resources even if the web application is marked as meta-data complete. (markt)|"Resources are not served from /WEB-INF/lib/{*.jar}/META-INF/resources if metadata-complete=""true"" is set in web.xml"|"To reproduce:
1. Make a Servlet 3.0 webapp (lets name it foo) with metadata-complete=""true"" attribute set on the web-app element in the /WEB-IBNF/web.xml.
2. Make a jar holding a single /META-INF/resources/index.html file. The jar should be placed in /WEB-INF/lib (lets name it bar.jar).
3. Start the web app in Tomcat 7.0.2 and in browser go to http://localhost:8080/foo/index.html.

Expected result: 200 response and index.html served.
Actual result: 404

If you modify the web.xml to metadata-complete=""false"" and restart the app now /foo/index.html will respond as expected.

I tried the same webapp with Glassfish v3.0.1 and it works as expected regardless what I set in metadata-complete attribute.

I made a quick look in the servlet 3.0 spec and as far as I can see metadata-complete only regulates annotation and web fragment processing. In the example bar.jar has nothing to do with annotations and it is not a web fragment either but it is still handled differently depending on the metadata-complete attribute."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50059

(markt)|NIO HTTP connector aborts GET requests incorrectly.|"I use NIO HTTP Tomcat connector org.apache.coyote.Http11NioProtocol to implement Comet streaming to Android phones. 
The application opens 'primary' persistent Comet connection to receive data from the server. Server sends data to the client periodically. Client can terminate this GET by sending ""disconnect"" GET command to the server. The ""disconnect"" command completes server response and cleans up client connection state. Each client has a unique client Id to identify it.

So the ""connect"" GET looks like: 
/WebContentGateway/Controller?clientId=notimportant&command=connect

And disconenct looks like:
/WebContentGateway/Controller?clientId=notimportant&command=disconnect
The problem I uncovered is that ""disconnect"" GET somehow gets truncated and never invoked on the server side (looks like it is ""lost""). I traced it with Wireshark and Tomcat does receive GET request, but just closes connection without invoking servlet/ sending GET response (the “disconnect” GET socket connection is obviously different from the “primary” connection).
I have both client and servlet code and can provide any support to reproduce the problem.
This problem did not exist with build 6.0.16, but can be replicated with the latest Tomcat 6 and 7. It is very important for me to resolve it -  NIO HTTP Tomcat does not look solid it this point.

Client code just send “connect” command followed by “disconnect”. There should not be any threading contention because I serialize sending commands in one thread. It hangs on readThread.join(); because ""primary"" thread does not terminate. Also, if I throttle the for loop by putting sleep, the problem does not occur, so it is some sort of a racing condition in Tomcat.

CLIENT CODE:

public class Test extends AndroidTestCase {
    private static final String CLIENT_ID_NOTIMPORTANT = ""clientId=notimportant"";
	private static String url = ""http://172.16.16.33/WebContentGateway/Controller?"";
	private static InputStream cometConnectionInputStream;
	private static Thread readThread;
    
    public void testConnectDisconnect() {
		for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	        try {
	            URL cometUrl = new URL(url + CLIENT_ID_NOTIMPORTANT + ""&command=connect"");

(markt)|[PATCH]Allow GzipOutputFilter to send partial result when flushBuffer() is called|"Created attachment 24979 [details]
patch for the making GzipOutputFilter work with early flush

As part of our site speed optimizations (at Linkedin) we bumped into a problem when trying to do partial flush of compressed content stream from Tomcat to the browser. We discovered the root cause to be a couple of long outstanding JDK bugs:

 http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4255743
 http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4813885

Basically, with the GzipOutputFilter turned on, the GZIPOutputStream it uses internally buffers the data that's been sent over, and does not flush to client (browser) when flushBuffer() is invoked.

We have produced a patch which we verified internally, that it did work to do a partial flush on the compressed stream. We also have a unit testcase included in the patch to quickly show the problem. 

Early flush is a quite useful technique that many sites out there can benefit from to speed up the page download/rendering time, and by having it working in tomcat would benefit the existing and new customers.

It is just a message. Tomcat stops regardless of it:
After printing the message Catalina#stopServer() performs System.exit(1) which results in Tomcat shutdown.

I think that when service launcher stops Tomcat, Catalina#server is not null. That can be used to differentiate the two use cases.

There could be improvements on how to stop Tomcat. E.g., to call Catalina.stop(). If that is the case, it would be better to use wait(10000) instead of sleep(10000) in StandardServer.await(), so that it could be woken by a notifyAll() call, or use interrupt() call to wake it up (if we know the thread).

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.3 (markt)|fix|49667|Ensure that using the JDBC driver memory leak prevention code does not cause a one of the memory leaks it is meant to avoid. (markt)|JdbcLeakPrevention class can register unregistered JCBC Driver|"Overview
Suppose there is an web application A that uses a database and registers a Driver with the java.sql.DriverManager, and a web application B that doesn't use a database but has a jar file in its WEB-INF/lib directory that contains the same Driver. Suppose you undeploy web application B.
Running the org.apache.catalina.loader.JdbcLeakPrevention class will actually register the Driver and leave it loaded! The cause is the way the DriverManager checks whether a ClassLoader has permission to load the Driver. It does that by calling Class.forName with the ClassLoader, which will load the class if the class has not been loaded by that ClassLoader. Loading a Driver class triggers the Driver to register itself. 

Steps to reproduce
Create two web applications: one which registeres a Driver with the java.sql.Drivermanager and one that uses no database. Put the jar containing the Driver class in the WEB-INF/lib directory of both applications. Deploy both in Tomcat. Then undeploy the latter one.
Inspect catalina.out, verify that there are no messages about a JDBC Driver being forcibly unregistered.
Create a memory dump using jmap and inspect the dump using jhat.

Actual results
The WebappClassLoader for the latter application is still present. Its ""rootset references"" page shows two reference chains from class java.sql.DriverManager:
Static reference from java.sql.DriverManager.readDrivers (from class java.sql.DriverManager) :
--> java.util.Vector@0xeb6eb3f0 (24 bytes) (field elementData:)
--> [Ljava.lang.Object;@0xeb6eb408 (20 bytes) (Element 2 of [Ljava.lang.Object;@0xeb6eb408:)

--> class oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver (84 bytes) (??:)
--> org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader@0xeb5a84a0 (157 bytes) 

and a similar one from java.sql.DriverManager.writeDrivers.

Expected results
The WebappClassLoader is not present in memory anymore.

(markt)|catalina.sh PID file handling not working if started by initscript|"the PID file handling was changed in 6.0.24 in catalina.sh, which avoid the use of an initscript to start tomcat proper (e.g. on CentOS/RHEL5). catalina.sh is currently too strict regarding existing PID file and has imho a too lightweight check.

Below is a patch which improves the PID file handling.

It fixes 2 issues.

Issue 1: tomcat won't start, if initscript has already created as root a PID file and changed permissions, that user tomcat would able to write it's PID into this file.

Fix: check existing PID file whether it's non-empty and if yes, check, whether PID is stale

Issue 2: catalina.sh unconditionally tries to remove the given PID file, not testing the case that it has no write access to the directory (e.g. /var/run).

Fix: check before removing a PID file (because this needs write access to pid file directory, which is e.g. /var/run, were user tomcat has no write access)

Pls. include this fix into upstream, thank you.

Catalina|Tomcat 7.0.3 (markt)|fix|49730|Fix a race condition in StandardThreadExector that can cause requests to experience large delays. Patch provided by Sylvain Laurent. (markt)|Race condition in StandardThreadExecutor : requests are sometimes enqueued instead of creating new threads|"In tomcat 6, I often configure an Executor with minSpareThreads=0 to work around memory leak issues upon redeployment.

Sometimes (especially in development), when I refresh a page of my webapp with Safari, Chrome or Firefox, some resources of the page take several seconds (>10s) to be served though they are static resources and should come in less than 50ms. For instance, over 15 requests for a page (1 for html, the others for resources like js, css, images...), I sometimes have 1 or 2 that take >10s. 

After analysis, I found that in org.apache.catalina.core.StandardThreadExecutor.TaskQueue.offer(Runnable) the statement 
if (parent.getActiveCount()<(parent.getPoolSize()))
is sometimes true unexpectedly. Here is the scenario :

- ThreadPoolExecutor is empty
- the user refreshes the page (or accesses it with an empty cache) in his web browser for a page that uses a more than 10-15 resources
- the browser establishes one TCP connection and a new Thread is created
- after the browser receives the response, it decides to load as many resources as possible in parallel. For this it establishes up to 6 TCP connections (in my tests)
- The Acceptor thread calls StandardThreadExecutor.execute to process each incoming connection.
- For each call, StandardThreadExecutor.TaskQueue.offer(Runnable) is being called
- if you study the sources of Java 6 ThreadPoolExecutor, you can see that there's a small delay between the time a new Thread is created (thus increasing poolSize) and the time it starts working on its first task (increasing the activeCount)
- Since in my case connections are established in a rapid burst, the calls to TaskQueue.offer() are sometimes faster than this small delay, so that we do have parent.getActiveCount()<parent.getPoolSize() and thus the task is enqueued instead of forcing the creation of a thread to serve it.
- Since Keep-Alive is enabled and tomcat 6 threads take care of only one TCP connection at a time, the requests in the queue must wait for the keep-alive timeout so that a Thread is returned to the pool to serve pending tasks.
- With 25s keepAliveTimeOut, it means that some requests take more than 25s to be served eventhough the pool was never full and the server quite idle!!!

Other facts about this issue :
- Although my test case starts with an empty pool, it can occur even on a loaded server. The thing that triggers the issue is the burst of new TCP connections.
- The problem is less severe with a lower keepAliveTimeout, or if keepalive is disabled. In any case, it also depends on the time taken to serve current requests.
- The issue also affects tomcat 7 but is less severe because tc7 threads are returned to the pool after each http request, even if the TCP connection is kept alive. The impact would the same as with tc6 with keepAlive disabled."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49730

Any request body provided at this point is now swallowed. (markt)|501 Method not implemented with successive POST requests|"Created attachment 25911 [details]
client wire/context log, client code, webapp code

An unexpected HTTP 501 occurs if using HttpComponents with successive POST requests against a simple Tomcat 7 servlet (Form-based POST Authentication is enabled). After a sucessfull authentication, the client requests the same protected resource a few times in a row, but the second request always returns a ""501 Method not implemented"" status. All other requests succeed.

The following communication takes place:
1. Client requests a protected resource; Tomcat returns the login page (HTTP200)
2. Client provides the user credentials and calls the login resource; Tomcat returns a redirect (HTTP302)
3. Client sets the location from the redirect for the next request(identical to URI from #1) and requests it; Tomcat returns the page (HTTP200)
4. Client requests the same resource again; Tomcat returns a HTTP501 - Method not implemented
5. Client requests the same resource again; Tomcat returns the page (HTTP200)
6. Client requests the same resource again; Tomcat returns the page (HTTP200)
7. Client requests the same resource again; Tomcat returns the page (HTTP200)

The access log message regarding the 501 says:
'""testName=testValuePOST /test/secure/ HTTP/1.1"" 501 1278', which may indicate that the entity data and the HTTP-method name somehow got mixed up!? Strangely the HTTP501 does not appear in case of a JSP for the requested resource, only if facing a form-based POST authentication Servlet. The servlet does only implement post and get(which calls the doPost) and returns just a string. The client code should be fine since I already posted this issue on the HTTPComponents mailing list and the data sent over the wire seems to be right. 

I attached the source/bin of the testclient and webapp and also the wire/context log of the client.

How can I provide further helpfull information?"|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49779

First, thank you for creating Tomcat! I've used it over and over again for more than a decade and it's been a wonderful help to me.

I've been tracking a bug in my app which seemed like a bug in HttpClient and now (according to the HttpClient guys) appears to be a bug in Tomcat.

Details of the bug, including analysis and test case, attached here:

   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-1048

Essentially if FormAuthenticator receives an HTTP request containing a 'Expect: 100-Continue' header, it is meant to respond with either a 100 or a 417 in order to request the body of the request. But instead, Tomcat is not responding at all. Luckily a 'fallback' use case of the spec is that the client should wait, say, 2 seconds then send the body anyway.

The result is that logging in takes much longer (2 longers versus 10ms) than expected, which can be a problem for people doing automated testing against FormAuthenticator.

Note the issue may affect use cases beyond FormAuthenticator too.

Richard."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50689

Patched JSSESocketFactory.java based on Tomcat 6.0.20

For the moment, a user must set the ""truststorePass"" in the SSL connector, even if this is not required by the JSEE API (Keystore.load() with null password is possible for truststores) and is also unwanted in a production environment with ""real"" truststores, because this may give someone the possibility to manipulate a productive trustore file or give more information than needed.
If the ""truststorePass"" is not set in the connector element, the current implementation will use the ""keystorePass"" as the value for ""truststorePass"" (strange wrong behaviour) and this will lead to an exception.
Proposal: do not set the ""truststorePass"" if omitted, leave it with null and the SSL connector still works.
This should also not affect old tomcat configurations, where the truststore password equals to the keystore password.

Hi,

I think the stopping of the Coyote AJP Connector doesn't work. In fact, if you go with jconsole on MBean Catalina->Connector->8009 and do ""Stop"" on ""operation tab"", nothing happens.

To reproduce this bug:
 * Download Tomcat 7.0.2 
 * Confingure an Apache httpd with a JkMount /examples/*
 * Use ab to generate request (ex:  ab -c 3 -n 1000000 ""http://localhost/examples/jsp/jsp2/el/basic-arithmetic.jsp"")

Coyote|Tomcat 7.0.3 (markt)|fix|49860|Add partial support for trailing headers in chunked HTTP requests. (markt)|getParameters() fails on chunked POST requests with trailers|"Created attachment 25967 [details]
Sample code to expose the issue

Overview: A servlet hosted on Tomcat fails to retrieve the request parameters when the request is using chunked transfer encoding and trailers.

Details: Sending a POST http request from a HTTP/1.1 client that uses chunked as transfer encoding and also includes trailers in the request (per RFC2616 sections 3.6.1 and 14.40):
Request: 
===========================
POST /echo/getBody HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: org.test.chunked.EchoClient (chunked-test)
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
connection: Close
host: localhost:8080
transfer-encoding: chunked

3
a=0
4
&b=1
0
x-Signature: Tuu2
============================

The server responds with an error message (see below) and a stack trace pointing to ChunkedInputFilter class (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc6.0.x/trunk/java/org/apache/coyote/http11/filters/ChunkedInputFilter.java).
The method parseEndChunk() inside this class has a to do comment to handle trailers - this leads me to believe the trailers in chunked requests are not yet supported.

The sample code attached contains means to reproduce the issue:
 - an Eclipse project TestHttpServer that hosts an EchoServlet
 - an Eclipse project TestHttpClient that sends and receives chunked requests and verifies them in a unit test
 - Eclipse's Tomcat server configuration
The code is an extension of the attachments from bug 37794 (https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37794) related to handling chunked requests in general.

Note that when removing the trailer in the request above, the server responds correctly and is able to extract the parameters sent in the request' body.

Here is the error response that the server sends back:

omit (optional) Valid values are true and false. If true, and when

The following does NOT work:

This simplifies the Catalina code as well as making it easier for Geronimo and others to integrate Jasper. Patch provided by David Jencks. (markt)|use an init-param for jspFile on explicit jsp servlets|"Created attachment 26017 [details]
patch to translate jsp-file elements to jspServlet init params

A <servlet> element in web.xml can include a jsp-file rather than a servlet class. Currently in catalina and jasper this is handled by a bunch of runtime code that tracks the jsp file outside the servlet and feeds it to the servlet as a request attribute.  This requires a bunch of runtime code, some of which is marked ""hold your nose"".

Instead, it's possible to supply the jsp-file as an init-param to the jsp servlet instance that is set up to handle this <servlet> element.  This makes runtime handling of these jsp servlets identical to all other servlets and transfers the small amount of jsp-aware code still needed in catalina to the deployment phase.

The attached patch appears to pass all the tomcat tests and doesn't appear to cause any tck problems in the geronimo-tomcat integration.

In this patch, JspServlet will still respond to the jsp file as a request attribute but catalina won't send it.  Thus jasper is backwards compatible with earlier catalina versions but catalina is not backward compatible for explicitly mentioned jsp-file in servlet elements with earlier jasper versions.

It would be helpful to geronimo to apply the JspServlet patch even if the catalina changes aren't applied as we are using this technique in the geronimo-jetty integration and are subclassing JspServlet to provide this behavior."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49916

Tested on apache-tomcat-6.0.29 running under jdk 1.6.0_18.

When DeltaManager is instantiated and assigned in StandardContext.start(),
is it done AFTER StandardContext.bindThreads().

DeltaManager, in turn, during initalization, asks for sessions in other nodes,
and this may result in creating threads in ThreadPoolExecutor in tribes.

These threads created with contextClassLoader set to current
webapplication WebAppClassLoader.

This results in memory leak and error message during redeployment in tomcat log:

=====

If we get a non-primary session,  a primary node is switched. 
However, isPrimarySession does not change to true. 
It is only a change of primary node.

I made a patch.
It contains the following. 
isPrimarySession is set to true in BackupManager#objectMadePrimay.
When get() is called in non-primary node, MapOwner#objectMadePrimay is called.

(markt)|SSI Servlet should support safe configuration|"The current configuration of the SSI module is ""All"" or ""None"". The ""ALL"" option will expose all the legacy Apache SSI directive (echo, printenv, if, exec, ...). As documented, allowing SSI will allow execution of arbitrary programs using the ""exec"". As a result, there is no safe way to expose sites/projects containing SSI directive, without taking a security risk, or reviewing of every file.

The ""exec"" directive, with the cmd option is a major risk. Even for Apache, you have the option to allowing the ""safe"" include (includeNoExec). The includeNoExec allow pages to be served, even when the content is not reviewed, or when users are allowed to upload content to the site.

I have a big site which need to be converted into JSP. I would like to use the SSI servlet to allow for transition over time. The extra risk from ( from exec cmd) make it impossible to deploy the SSI.

My request: Modify the configuration of SSI as follow: By default, it will only allow ""safe"" directive (no exec cmd=...). This will eliminate the risk from arbitrary execution of commands (""del *.*""). It will also remove many potentail load problems. The cmd= should only be allowed using a directive like ""allowUnsafeExec"", which will default to false.

I think that the change will make it easier to use the SSI feature, without exposing the server to big risk. The risk associated with the ""safer"" version of SSI is similar to the risk from running JSP pages."|https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48960

At Tomcat shutdown I have quite often following message

SEVERE: The web application [/] appears to have started a thread named [http-8001-exec-1] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak. 

Looking into the details it appears that a request is still being processed. The thread that is detected as leak is not a user thread but Tomcat's executor thread.

I'm not sure what would be the right behaviour here: complain about a request that is still being processed or to wait for it. In any case, Tomcat shouldn't complain with current message as it is too misleading and leads to ignoring real memory leak messages.

The root cause of the problem is the strategy used to detect threads started by a web app which isn't able to correctly identify threads started by Tomcat itself (contextClassLoader is changed at each request). A solution could be to use a ThreadGroup to identify ""Tomcat threads"". If you see this as a good solution, I can try to prepare a patch.

The patch for WebdavServlet

The WebdavServlet does not work with native Windows clients besides the deprecated Web Folders. The more modern, common and supported by Microsoft client, Windows Mini-Redirector that allows mapping of WebDAV shares to local drives cannot mount a WebDAV share served by tomcat's WebdavServlet.

You can observe this by using the following command from a windows machine:

> net use * http://hostname:8080/webdav

It should fail without the attached patch. The reason is that:

DAV: namespaced elements in a PROPFIND responses can not use a default namespace; each element must be explicitly prefixed with a namespace prefix defined in itself or a parent. If a default namespace is used the client will give no errors, but will not display any resources.

This is mentioned here, albeit for a single Windows version, Windows Server 2003:

 system: the jvm will be asked for the default charset. This charset will usually be set by system locale.

In TC6 there is a separate pre-startup phase when starting Tomcat, to allow Connectors to bind to their ports before other parts of Tomcat are started.

IIRC, it is implemented by having separate Bootstrap#load(String[]) and Bootstart#start() methods [1].

[1] http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html#Downgrading_user


When running with jsvc it will mean that Tomcat would not be able to bind to privileged ports (80).

I do not use jsvc, but I observe this issue when testing the fix for bug 49030 + bug 48625 that I applied in r957960. Essentially, it breaks the fix for BZ 48625.

To reproduce:

1. Add the following line to conf/catalina.properties

org.apache.catalina.startup.EXIT_ON_INIT_FAILURE=true

2. Start two Tomcat instances with the same configuration at the same time. The first instance starts successfully. The second instance fails, as expected, but not in the expected way.

3. Expected behaviour:

I would expect that in StandardService#initInternal() the connector.init() call fails, because it cannot bind to the port.

The exception from connector.init() is caught there and, if EXIT_ON_INIT_FAILURE flag is set, it is rethrown, then caught in Catalina#load() and then rethrown as an Error, which aborts Tomcat startup.


4. Actual behaviour:

The exception does not happen, because the connector does not try to bind to the port. It will bind when start() is called.

I'm using an Embedded Tomcat.
I want to use the Tomcat's functionality - default context.xml.

I'm extending the org.apache.catalina.startup.ContextConfig.
Sometimes the default context.xml is outside of the ""base"" directory, because of this I'm using the following method to set the location - in the java doc it is stated that an absolute path is acceptable for method parameter.

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc6.0.x/tags/TOMCAT_6_0_26/java/org/apache/catalina/startup/ContextConfig.java

223    public void setDefaultContextXml(String path) {
224
225        this.defaultContextXml = path;
226
227    }

When ContextConfig.contextConfig() method is invoked, a wrong path is generated for the default context.xml
i.e.

If the base directory is d:/base-dir
and the path to the default context.xml is d:/other-dir/configuration/context.xml

the following is generated:
d:/base-dir/d:/other-dir/configuration/context.xml

This happens in ContextConfig.java:

715    /**
716     * Process the default configuration file, if it exists.
717     */
718    protected void contextConfig() {
          ...
728            processContextConfig(new File(getBaseDir()), defaultContextXml);
          ...
734    }

737    /**
738     * Process a context.xml.
739     */
740    protected void processContextConfig(File baseDir, String resourceName) {

752        }
          ...
819    }

Could you please clarify whether it is possible to use this setter method with absolute paths?

Two problems with exception thrown by ProxyDirContext.lookup

The consequence is that the exception thrown contains a stacktrace that has nothing to do with the current execution stack. This makes difficult to find the root cause of a problem. If this is really an optimization (what is the gain), then what about making this field static?

Crap!  It is not even looking at the parameters.  Ok, Java matches on method names and method parameters.  It is commonly called a method signature. 

Well, Jasper is in the Google SDK, so it could perhaps be smarter than I am -- so maybe I overlooked something.  Is that the case?

Why can't the Jasper compiler match on parameters like Java?  This is after all Java.  I'm only using TLDs because they are cleaner then escaping Java code in JSP.  I have already wrote a considerable amount of TLD code and it does not easily mix with the expression language.  This is the reason why it is so important to have this implementation work as expected.

Please let me know how I can help.  Lets get this fixed.

Patch adding target checkstyle to main build.xml with a extrem minimal number of checks

Tomcat code style is not consistent but it should be (it would give more time to discuss about unit tests rather than about code style).

Rather than to propose a huge patch in one time, I propose a simple one that:
- adds a checkstyle target to the build.xml
- adds a chestyle.xml configuration file (the ""sun coding conventions"") with nearly everything deactivated (otherwise it gives over 80000 style errors)
- activates only check for tabs

With this check the checkstyle target fails as a lot of files still contain a tab character. A find / replace by a committer makes far more sense than providing it in the patch as it would be more difficult to review.

Of course it would make sense to add this target to the default build.

  PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();
  writer.print(""hello world"");
  writer.println(); //FIXME ignores System.getProperty(""line.separator"") and always outputs \r\n

This means that if you use a servlet Writer on a Unix system to output any text based data format which is defined as requiring Unix format line endings ('\n'), that data will be corrupted.

This appears to be because org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteWriter does:
--------
private static final char[] LINE_SEP = { '\r', '\n' };

public void println() {
  write(LINE_SEP);
}
--------

This used to work in Tomcat 4.

Looking at the old code at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/archive/tc4.0.x/tags/tc4.0.6/connectors/coyote/src/java/org/apache/coyote/tomcat4/CoyoteWriter.java it appears to defer line endings to the PrintWriter base class which does the right thing.

Was this change was made to output HTTP headers properly or something?  It specifically seems to override the default behavior to do this.  I don't know the code well enough to determine if the attached patch to revert to the default behavior again would break something?

Patch including tests that fixed the problem for us.

Currently Tomcat does not support unloading JSPs. When constantly changing and reloading JSP files (especially during development time) this causes the JVM to run out of memory.

The patch fixes this problem by tracking the last time a JSP page was requested. Objects are destroyed if a configurable number of JSPs is live, starting with the ""oldest"" ones. This behaviour is deactivated by default. It must be configured explicitly.

The patch comes with tests that check the added functionality. To make testing easier I added easymock as dependency to the classpath.
